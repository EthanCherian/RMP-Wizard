She likes to make fun of her students when they are doing dissections because she's the 'master' of them.  She also treats her students as if they were stupid.  Avoid her if you can! I worked my ass off and got a B+. \n",

            "Istarted this semester with a positive attitude, well that was knocked down after the first 3 days. I just wanted the class to be over.

            "Annoying, slow and extremely disgusting when he eats and teach at the same time!\n",
            "I must admit that he seems like outside of class he might be good company, but in class he moves too fast, goes on stupid tangents, and worst of all he is arrogant and talks WAY too much about HIMSELF... we don't want to hear about his compositions, we want to hear about the course material so we can pass the exams.\n",
            "The worst professor the face of this earth. He' extemely boring, and attempts to make jokes that represent his bland personality. He may know a lot but is horrible in relaying this information to his students. He needs to become a janitor of the school\n",

            "By far the best professort I have had at USD- especially for the Poli Sci Dept. Great human being! Wants to teach- he worked for the Stae Dept for 30 years. Very nice, humorous, and unbiased. To bad USD is too stupid to let him get away to Chapman Univ.\n",
            "first of all he pronounces theta like &quot;tee-tah.&quot;  also he sucks at life.  I can't stand to hear this man teach.  he's from rumania and can't speak english.  he's a very jolly man, which is cool and all, but he simply can't communicate in english.  not worth the tuition.  sorry petru, peace out\n",

            "I liked her a lot. The quizzes suck, but if you participate then they don't count. Class is a little boring, but she doesn't have much reading to do for hoework and she's available outside of class to discuss assignments, so take advantage!\n",
            "Very boring teacher and grades harder than she needs to. I worked my butt off and it wasn't worth it. I felt like she favored certain students.\n",

I got a B because of this jerk.  And then, two weeks after my terrible test, he broke down crying in class talking about his bipolar disorder.  Hypocrite!!\n",

He wanted us to respect him, HOW, HES BEEN GONE FOR OVER A MONTH! were behind every other calculus class and he promised wed finish more than them.  I dont know how he still has his job.  He should stop wasting our time and stealing our tax money with his idiocy he calls teaching.\n",

            "summer 07 was petru's 1st time teaching the course so he wasn't able to fit all the usual material into the 6weeks. Seems impossible to me. Petru is still the man though!! I know he tried his best plus he made the final really easy in compensation.\n",
            "She is energetic and very personable. I had to miss two weeks of class because I was in a play and she worked with me. We only had two speeches and a 25-30 minute debate as our final. She is hilarious and you'll enjoy all three hours each week. And YOU WILL BW IN CLASS FROM 6:30 until 9:01 pm. Dont EVER expect to get out early! STudy and you'll get\n",
            "He is the worst.  When i took him for fall of 05, he didnt teach us anything for the 1st 3 weeks cuz he had 10 people waiting outside of class to add (he wouldnt let them sit in class).  Then when he did teach us, he only got through chapter 1 in about 8 weeks, and after that, stopped showing up to class.  The time we did know him, he was the worst\n",
            "I took her Psych   class in Fall of 06 and she was my favorite professor. She is very clear and helpful in her teaching style. You have to get up in front of the class and debate on certain issues from the text, but it is really easy and fun, take it from someone who hates public speaking. I got an A+ in the class. Taker her!\n",
            "I enjoyed taking Mr. Bracy for both DMATH 091 & 093...very easy as long as you practice..practice...practice!!!\n",
            "You WILL roll your eyes the entire class.  It is easy work, but pointless work.  Your patience will be tested, and you will NEVER be let out early.  You'll do some powerpoints, write some letters, give some presentations, etc.  Attendance is required.  You will get an A if you do the work.  It is easy, but like licking 10,000 envelopes, is a pain i\n",
            "This guy is a piece of crap.  Took him 30 mins in to open 3 PPT files to lecture the class.  He has the course setup so you just memorize CICA HB sections.. great, but where is the logic in that  Even if you have a hold of his slides, they are useless as he is looking for specific wording from the HB.  0MG! l0l!

            "Cute russian math professor. 3 tests, 7 quizzes, 1 final. a C is %65. Very nice to students. Can answer questions very clearly. Never at her office though. Excellent at drawing 3d shapes. Tests are identical to homework or lecture problems. Helps out on test problems. Teaches the course at the simplest level possible.\n",
            "If you think your tough and can handle a crummy instructer...good for you. But don't take her class! She is horrible! She will take your test and puke red all over it, even if your test is a high %80, she will make sure you leave with nothing over a %60! Run as far as you can from this woman!\n",
            "Summaries that you must do but are simple and gives you %100 if completed! no tests or quizzes just participate and do extra credit and you have a very high chance of getting an A! he cancelled class like 5 times so that was cool too! Class is boring for the most part though\n",
            "Alot of freshmen had a hard time with him because its so easy to focus on the hundreds of pages of notes from his lectures. I studied the book during his lectures because thats where he draws %100 of his test material and I got an A.\n",
            "Very likeable and funny prof.Does get a little sidetracked.Class is 60% lecture,& %40 discussion,but he reads his lecture from notes, & can be pretty dull.Uses too many references to other novels those in this intro type class may not be familiar with.If you want to learn he's the one to take.\n",
            "Very flamboyant guy! Gotta love the printed shirts. Got %100 on 2 and A's on other 2. Go to class most of the time, do assignments (NOT hard!) and you'll be okay. All you do in class is group work, pretty pointless but necessary. He's a great guy, rides bike EVERYWHERE. I don't think he owns a car:)\n",
            "Outstanding and interesting professor. Although he's not there half of the time, his TA is great at picking up where he leaves off. Attendance is not totally mandatory, but %10 of the exams are what he thinks about a topic. Two exams which totals %90 of your grade, then a written assignment for %10. Overall, a pretty rockin' professor.\n",
            "Lectures are very boring, I retained very little each class. By the end of the semester I simply did the homework in class and taught myself using the text. His grading is very unfair, I'd regularly lose %20 on a test/quiz on nit picky things, though I obviously understood the material. Unfortunately I have to take calc II with him next sem... ****\n",
            "this is a great class.. you do not need to buy your book you will never touch it.. and if you do need it just use the library's copy.. she has a lot of ez points so the tests don't hurt you as much.. the only hard part about her class is her tests.. also as for antecedence it is worth %5 of your final grade. and the lab is ez too..\n",
            "Very unclear teacher. Participation in class counted as %15 of the final grade and he never told anyone until after the fact how he would determine your score. He offered a final with 4 multiple choice questions. More then half the class missed the same question and received 75's. He did this only because he needed to lower the class average. AVOID\n",
            "One of my two most favorite professors on campus. He is at the top of his field yet he still loves to hear his students' opinions. If you participate in class he will like you. He grades pretty tough, it's near impossible to get a %100. If you read you will do well.\n",
            "Not the best professor, but definitely manageable. A little difficult understand, but if you look over the concepts before class, you should be able to understand what's happening on the board. Doesn't drop grades! Missed the first test, got him to average my other test grades together overall. Homework counts for %20, so do it!  Old but nice.\n",
            "Jordan is the fairest teacher I've ever had. If you ask him. he will literally tell you the exact question that will be on the test (excluding the exact numbers). The grades are structured such that a %50 on both the final and midterm will warrent a %75 'C'. The lab is super easy and accounts for %25 of the final grade.\n",
            "Just to clarify: if you take her twice a week, %30 of the time you will get out 20-30 minutes early. 30% of the time you will get out 30-40 minutes early, and 40% of the time you will be out around scheduled. I read the text a little because the Dr. inspired me to. Have a good grasp on notes and study guide and youll do well. Love this woman.\n",
            "tough class but learned alot, over %50 of the class failed the 2 test.  this class goes well if you use the free tutors in the center\n",
            "I got a decent grade in this class, but it was %100 due to the T.A.'s This class is extremely frustrating for students who are trying to get good grades because the teacher is so incompetent. I wish i could take the portion of my tuition that goes to him, and give it to the two student T.A's, because this class is NOT worth paying for.\n",
            "This class was easy for me. He is one of the best teachers. There is opportunities to earn extra credit too. Our final counts as %40 of our grade. I know I'm getting an A this semester and if you get anything less than you deserve it.\n",
            "Prof. Wilson is awesome! I loved his class, he made math very easy for me. Homework was online and you could retake it till you got %100!\n",
            "Law will make your life a living hell if you take her class. The worksheets take at least 5 hours and you get 1 a week. Also, good luck finishing the exams; %95 of the class never finished in 50 mins. She will grade everything you write on tests: grammar, notes, scratch work, simple math. Count on working your a** off to get a C.\n",
            "I am blown away by her class. She I so clear and is always willing to go over things. She doesnt judge students understanding by bombarding us with work. However, she allows students to be responsible for learning topics that we go over as a class. DeAngelis is literally my favorite teacher starting college and would recommend her %100.\n",
            "I promise you, EASIEST class I have EVER taken in my life! Never went to class, read through chapters, did study guide and reviewed ppt slides and got over %100 on all three tests. Interesting subject too. You will not regret taking this class.\n",
            "class is mandatory and there's a seating chart. His tests are %100 verbatim from the required reading. His lectures are just his own philosophy on the state of the world, but he stutters and doesn't allow for class involvement or discussion.\n",
            "In Engr   every freshman engineer has the same main lecture. Attendance is required and its %25 on the midterm. Its a really boring class so bring other homework to do during it. However its a nice easy credit, especially for engineering.\n",
            "His lectures were interesting but not very visual so if you need that beware. Grade is based off of 30% quiz total, 30% Midterm and %40 final. I found the tests easy and there were many opportunities for XC though (but i'd beware if you don't test well). Overall nice guy, decent lectures, but very test based.\n",
            "Cant teach, Simply copies stuff from his notes on over head w/o explanation, useless tutorials, midterm avg was less than %40. Overall he shouldnt be teaching any material at SFU\n",
            "Horrible teacher. A little over half of the class failed lin alg. To bring the average up she just omitted the scores below %40 (and there were alot of people below %40)\n",
            "I took every ECO and ITB class of him. Giving take home exams which has 5 questions and you have to pick 3. He will tell you that your paper is plagiarized even you made it %100 pure. Don't be bothered. You will get an A anyway.\n",
            "Very helpful and lively. If you are looking for an easy A, look no further. Will be taking her as much as I can! One problem is that she tends to  make some conservative comments that I found quite off from a college professor, such as women belong in the kitchen. It's annoying but you don't really have to show up to class %100 to get an A! :)\n",
            "speaks a mile a minute. no office hours. will NOT make time for a student. Will not explain concepts to students. First test, highest score was %45. Class started with 30 students, when I dropped early October class was down to 10 students. Very difficult teacher\n",
            "by far the strictest prof. I've ever had, very old school. Tests are confusing beyond whats needed. not the greatest leader of the class either, lets people chat while others are still taking mid terms. never let's class out early, If your late, your absent. If you leave 15 min early, your absent. attendance is %10 percent of grade.\n",
            "Haddad is a smart old guy, he speaks fast and rambles continuously. Some of the time it's humorous. Most of the time it's just annoying. I would conservatively estimate that %70 of the class time was eaten up in his paranoid Republican yammerings. I missed many classes but still managed a B.\n",
            "I guess if you agreed with her %100 on everything then she would be fine.  If you don't agree with her than you will have to pretend to to pass the class.  She treats her opinions as facts.\n",
            "This teacher needs to go back to the planet he came from. During his first year at GCC %75 of the class dropped. Everyone hated him. I hope he gets fired cuz he sucks big time. I feel sorry for anyone who ever has him.\n",
            "Buckham is an absolute master of statics.  Along with his knowledgable TA's you can pretty much ask anyone any question and they will answer it.  Even had a TA email me a solution that they worked on for 2 days.  Everyone wants you to succeed.  If you put in %100 there is no way you won't walk out with at least a B.\n",
            "BORING! If youre interested in sociology DO NOT take him. Rambles on meaninglessly. 90% lets us out a couple minutes late. Gives study guide with 100+ terms/names but only tests you on less than half. Be forewarned - he will call you out if youre talking, studying for another class, or doing ANYTHING besides paying attn. Good news is %60-79 is a C\n",
            "He's a great teacher! He never gives homework and he gives so much extra credit that you can get a final grade of A from his class after getting 66% in midterm and %73 in the final exam.\n",
            "Eh, here class is a little too easy, Her papers are very easy which makes me not want to do them because they are uninteresting to write about. Her Final project consists of the final paper and 2 revised papers that are over %50 different from the original... She is a good teacher though, she is very helpful when needed\n",
            "The course is interesting but his tests are EXTREMELY difficult. He said less than %50 pass his first exam. I managed a %66 on it but it was very difficult to overcome that grade even after doing well on the other tests. I would stay away from this class if you care about your gpa. Also attendance is mandatory.\n",
            "Five minute youtube videos taught me more than he did in 50 minute lectures. Lots of coding theory, very little coding application. Powerpoints are jumbled nonsense that confuse rather than assist. Grading is easy at first but gets exponentially harder towards the end of the class. Average grade in the class I took - %65.8. \n",
            "kid who said she hates athletes def played lacrosse... but i totally agree she did hate them. no hw, no tests.. one project at the end and like 3 papers worth %5 of your grade collectively. class is pretty easy just hope you like cameras\n",
            "There are two tests and Final. Grade: He doesn't go by percentage grading scale. If you are in the top 20% = A. And the next %40 = B. (This grading system could be either good or bad to some people). He doesn't give any extra credit, also not many partial credits in the quiz. However, he tries hard to make students understand lectures.\n",
            "I am Chem major with perfect attendance.  I did not understand how what he said connected to the material. He would beat the same horse to death while never covering the material we were expected to learn.  I regularly met with him after class, and got some help but not enough.  Class average on tests was %50.  Do not take him!\n",
            "huge hypocrite: wont let students in door for being seconds late, yet shows up late half the time. won't let students say anything in seminar if its not %100 related to text but hell interject with unrelated rants all the time.he's a GENIUS, which is why he has such a big ego.take his class only if you're a serious student who can deal with jerks\n",
            "I think he's great. He's down to Earth, fun, and funny. The class is a breeze. I finished with %100.\n",
            "Great class to take if you need a science with a lab. The subject is boring if you're not into ES. Easy A because he always added %10 to our tests and exams. A's start at 85% and you can bring notes with you to all tests and exams. The professor just wants you to do good in the class and is always willing to help you. He's funny too!\n",
            "He is very knowledgable but the class was still a bit hard. He gives quizzes about %99 of the time, so make sure you READ ALL CHAPTERS and he follows the syllabus to the letter. So, in his mind there is no excuse to not know whats going on. Mandatory Gordon Rule papers and you MUST pass them to pass his class. If possible try another teacher first.\n",
            "Unrealistic expectations from class, a full understanding in any situation is needed to pass the exams.  In my class, the test averages never broke %50.\n",
            "Yes, this class is in fact very diffucult. No matter how good of a writer you think yourself to be. You will never guess what he wants you to write because its all in his head. Unfortunately I am no mind reader. Although you DO LEARN, the effort has to be %100 YOU. I do recommend if you're willing to put up with his unspoken requests and stress.\n",
            "Easy class overall. You'll only need to read 8-10 essays in the essay book. He's generous when it comes to grading essays. But his multi. choice questions are difficult (can't guess). Regular attendance can add up to %20 of your grade per exam (provided that you read the assigned essays and pay attention during lecture). Can't beat that. Funny too.\n",
            "Put it to you this way. The Final exam is the take home prefinal that you can do over and over again on the internet until you get %100. All you have to do, is do his work and its difficult not getting full credit. He has a good sense of humor as well. He makes learning easy.\n",
            "Horrible Lectures, long tangents on unimportant matters, only %10 of material in lecture is on tests.  Books costly and overall an unpleasent experience.\n",
            "boring teacher and at times rude (makes an example of students in huge lectures who are talking) and assigns his own textbook to be read.  macro econ is taught around the US and not very internationally. he's conservative. pop quizzes make up %15 of grade and make you have to go to lectures that are useless.  Try and take a different teacher\n",
            "This was the worst class I have taken.  If you plan on taking this class, dont ask questions because he will pretty much tell you, your stupid for asking.  Also dont ask for help because you will not recieve any.  The LABS, HOMEWORK, and Quizes must be done inorder to pass the class but in the final grade they count for 0.  TEST are %100 of grade.\n",
            "The worst class, and the worst professor I have ever had in my entire life. %40 midterm 1, %60 Final.  Only one midterm, so you better be on top of your game when you take his class, because one mistake will ruin your GPA.\n",
            "knows nothing about the subject, ****s about his so called real estate properties in mexico and palm springs. If you %40-55 avergae he will give you a C\n",
            "Amazing professor. He is so intelligent, but so down to earth and not intimidating at all! Readings were interesting, and he was a fair marker. If you take his class, go to his office hours! He is very friendly and interesting, and he won't let you leave until you are %100 confident with your essay idea. Highly reccommended.\n",
            "Lois is a very nice lady, but she is very tough on her exams, that make up %50 of your grade. With weekly tests, and large exams, it's very hard to study for such a BROAD variety of material. She is very specific with her questions, and is very difficult to follow in lecture. Also, when asking questions, she beats around the bush.\n",
            "As a heads up, an A in his class is a %96.7.\n",
            "If you take volleyball all you have to do is show up to get an A. Like %90 of the grade is attendance/participating. She is nice and trys to make class fun. If you just need a PE credit take volleyball super fun and easy.\n",
            "I would have got %100 had the test been on her son's illnesses.  Bring a pillow cause you'll be there for all 4 hours\n",
            "She's a very interesting teacher. The class is pretty easy and kind of fun. About %50 group projects. She tells a lot of jokes and makes the class laugh, she is good at teaching, and she's also attractive!\n",
            "Audrey is a wonderful dance teacher and person. She is always kind and full of energy during class. You can walk into this class with no prior skills and learn how to swing dance pretty decently. She is very patient and will always help if you are struggling with a certain move. Would recommend and take again %100!\n",
            "shes an ok teacher, boring class with slides. the only thing i didnt like about the exams was that she expects you to know what things are when she never discussed it during lecture. wording on exams is a little tricky. average for exams is around %60\n",
            "His classes are fun to be in. If you pay attention to detail you will get a fair mark. Don't worry about a lower than expcted mark b/c at the end all his marks are scaled by 1.2. So all you need is %83 to get %100 Ps. Don't forget prtnrs name:}\n",
            "He was very nice, clear, and uderstandable.  Easy to get A. as long as you study his notes.  there are %25 attendance so u better be there.I really recommend you to take a class with him.\n",
            "She earns her paycheck instead of collecting it.  Organized, knows what materials needs to get covered.  Uses Labs that would be helpful in RWA or it will share history of computing which is also nice to learn.  Does have a weighted grade system 25%H/Q, 25%Topic Paper %50 test some professors just have test grades so be happy.\n",
            "I take every course that Molto offers. Basically, he only asks questions on the exams that are in the lecture slides. There are two exams, and the best is worth %55 and the other %45. If you have a biology background, you are probably set. Just read the lecture slides and know the people  acronyms or definitions. There are no surprises. \n",
            "Do you appreciate the Physics? If you answered no, you will fail his lab. If you answered yes, you may get %50. But seriously in all seriousness worst lab instructor, at the entire campus. Avoid at all costs and if you must take him (like most engineering students) accept the fact that your GPA will drop\n",
            "Professor Scotten is extremely helpful, knowledgeable. He loves his job. I learned a lot in his class during summer. we had only 30 multiple choice on our final. super easy if u attend his classes he will give student hint and sometimes the questions that r in final.each time u show up in his class u earn % of ur final grade up to %25.\n",
            "Heidi is an amazing professor. I decided to major in business and was fairly sure of my choice going in. Well, after taking this class, I am %100 confident in my major decision. She is helpful, kind, and you can tell she cares for each student individually. \n",
            "Wow. This class was weird. The amount of homework assigned was ridiculously large. The handouts given out in class required half the trees in Oregon to be chopped down for the paper. You might think that you're going to fail half way through, but if you stick it out, do the majority of the homework, and get a %30 on the final, you'll pass.\n",
            "Good teacher, but hard to get an  A  from. I think I have held a %89.  in every class!\n",
            "She is an amazing, sweet lady. She can be really repetitive, but she is really helpful when you get confused. She uses the textbook alot but she mostly makes powerpoints derived from the textbooks so if you cant afford one, you dont NEED one for this class. I suggest her %100\n",
            "I am only on week 9 of 16... so far Mr Jackson has gave lectures about everything EXCEPT the text. the problem about that is that the tests are on the text book. he shows up 10-15 minutes late everyday and is very unorganized. his class is graded as follows: 2 quizzes (worth %20 of grade each) and 2 exams (worth %30 of grade each). TOO HARD!!!!\n",
            "EASY A. Gives study guides out wayy ahead of test time. Lectures are %90 random and useless. Just know the terms on the study guides. Gives attendance points. Lets you remake any test and our class retook the first two tests for the better grade. Gives EASY reading quizzes that are short. TAKE HIM IF YOU HATE POLY SCI! EASYYYYY. I made an A+.\n",
            "SUPER EASY! Test is 50 questions of the 100 question study guide. If you show up to class when there is a quiz you automatically get a %100. Almost Impossible to get a bad grade.\n",
            "I loved her class! I also took her for ENC  she is always helpful and nice to everyone. Work with the syllabus and you will get %100. She also does some gaming extra credits once in a blue moon.\n",
            "All we did in class was watch videos on youtube that had nothing to do with the test material. He doesn't post anything on D2L which is frustrating when trying to review for tests or look up grades. A lot of the things we talked about in class had little to do with the test, the average test score was always around %60 :/\n",
            "An amazing professor and has been by far the best I've had so far at UMich.  The class is A LOT of work, especially in the last month, but grade wise the class will probably get you a better grade than regular Orgo 2 just based off the fact that the class isn't 100% exams (it's like %50).  Great class though.\n",
            "Get ready to work on your own. Tons of onlinein class assignments. Spent the first 8 weeks revising the syllabus and has the weirdest curve ever (only for people who got ( - ) they received a C but no curve for the others. You will need  the learning smart code ($60) plus the text book. Less than %50 who passed the class after the curve. \n",
            "Alice is fanstatic; she brought to light many issues that had never crossed my mind before I met her.  Although I don't agree with her %100 percent of the time, she was still a fantastic professor and one I will always remember.\n",
            "Dr. Hwang is pretty freaking amazing. He's got a great sense of humor and is passionate about his teachings. And he'll give you short readings to get to on your own time. He's a fair grader. I swear to God, if you come to class, take a few notes, and read the required readings, you'll leave this class with a %100. Too easy.\n",
            "absolutely the best math teacher I've had to date. As long as you do your work he will be there for you %100. I just wish he taught higher lvl math. He dresses in the brightest clothes you'll ever see a man wear, and is older than dirt, but one hell of a guy. And FYI he dresses as a woman every year for Halloween!\n",
            "it was kind of hard class for me as it was my first math class in college, i worked extremely hard with 0 absent . with this teacher the only helpful thing was,he gives 5 exams drops the lowest plus the final so %25 each . his teaching was helpful for me. I ended it up with B+ which was great for me. In general math is hard class itself .\n",
            "Do not listen to the people who give this guy a high rating. He knows the subject but cannot teach it. You might as well not go to class. Because you learn nothing from his lectures. You actually come out more confused. I have yet to see my grade but he says that a C is an a and a %40 is like a D.He wil tell you one thing and do another each class.\n",
            "He has a very nice curve for the class. Guarantee at least %50 on each exam and only basic questions were on it not to mention he curved our final grade also. All you had to do was to study the old exams and you're good to go. No homework was required to do for this class but if you want to get a decent grade then do it.\n",
            "Honestly, i took this class with Rey because he was my adviser and he seemed okay. My experience in this class has been terrible. Nothing we talk about in class translates to the test. My class basically bombed the midterm which is %35 of your grade. His pretentiously polished character becomes annoying at one point and the class sucks overall.\n",
            "This was not a hard class. But there were a lot of assignments including MPs and HWs. But MPs are not that hard (mostly you can get at least more than 90%) and the curve was pretty sweet. You can get A if you are mostly more than 82%. A+ was around %92. So if you finished every assignment and study lecture slides a bit, A/A+ is guaranteed.\n",
            "Her accent gets really annoying and it comes off like she is always yelling at you. If you don't concentrate on her voice, you won't hear anything. The sams program online is pretty self teaching, I wish I would have taken this online. I didn't study for the first test and got a %100. \"hard copy\" sounds like \"hot coffee\" lol\n",
            "His test was really hard. I got my results the other day and it wasn't that pleasing. Too late to switch out to another class. Way to go on ruining my GPA. I should have took the reviews from here serious. I thought I could make it but apparently its impossible. %64 first test, only 3 chapters.\n",
            "No Homework or anything Like that. But either you study 24 hours or 3 weeks before his test. You willl FAIL the test. He teaches very well but his tests are HARD. Took first test, got the result and it was %50 :( (Studied 2 days) +  I take Massive notes so you just go and figure.\n",
            "She is clear on what you need to do pass, read the textbook and come to class, reading the textbook is especially important as she does in class writing once a week to test you on your knowledge, they're %20 but she drops the lowest 3, tests are 70+ multiple choice. she gives great review sheets. lectures are interactive as well.\n",
            "At least he was a teacher, rather than a moderator.  Biggest complaint is how he graded the assignments.  You expect each question on a 5 question assignment to be worth 20%.  In one case one was %40.  I would suggest asking early for how many points a question is worth, how many you received, and explanation on why you received that.\n",
            "Class wasn't too crazy (night course).It consists of 1 quiz per week (online so you can use your book) and usually 4 pages of a paper every 3 weeks. Midterm/Final are two 4 paged essays, but as long as you cite your sources throughout the papers, you'll be fine. Not super hard (because the quizes=easy 100%s for %15/grade) but not an easy A either.\n",
            "Worse class of my college career thus far. TA's taught over %95 of the classes, plus TA's accent was far to thick to understand. Better off reading from the book. when she did teach class she would mock you if you asked questions, very easily angered as well. Test are very difficult if you do not study. Avoid a all costs get another teacher.\n",
            "AVOID!! Seriously, I am an A student and English is my fortÃ©. I've never failed an English class, or even made a B, and I made a D for the semester. It doesn't matter if your paper is perfect, you automatically get a D if your paper doesn't meet the length requirement, even if it's like 50 words short like mine was, and that's %50 of your grade.\n",
            "Section attendance is mandatory, and participation/attendance/reading responses count for %35 of your grade. But I went to every single lecture and never read the books, and still got an A. The class was decent, but she talked almost entirely about Chinese history... kinda left out Korea and Japan when it was supposed to be about all three equally.\n",
            "There is a lot of work for the class, but it pays off.  His lectures are interesting, if you pay attention you will do well on the tests.  I scored %100 on all but two quizzes, because he tests exactly on his lectures.  Only deducts 4% of a grade for late papers, too, and encorages people to turn them in late rather than turn in poor quality work.\n",
            "i did not expect this response from everyone else. i thought she was easy and very nice. very clearn notes. i got a B+ and never studied. she gives %5 extra credit on tests for attendance. i would take her class again\n",
            "Showed up less than %50 of the time, often without any notification to the students at all. When she did show up to class she just ranted about her personal political beliefs and made no connections to critical thinking. Even though we were 3/4 of the way through the semester we hadn't done anything. Showed us pictures of naked morbidly obese peopl\n",
            "Very humorous, clear, professional, well-educated, entertaining professor. He returns your tests and gives a free %10 in the course just for showing up.  Encourages students to engage in critical thinking and to voice our opinions on topics. He is one professor who genuinely cares for his students, which is not common to cross.\n",
            "I found O'Hagen very unapproachable and incredibly unhelpful. I was incredibly illprepared for the final which is %50. After comparing chapter tests with freinds with a differnt   profs, I realized how much more difficult O'Hagen exams are.  My grade went up 10% in   simply because my new prof was testing at the appropriate level.\n",
            "I took this Med term class on campus and it was so easy.  Study the chapters for the tests which I could study in two days and you will get a 100 on the tests.  THe tests are easy.  She is VERY helpful and nice!!  She does everything she can to get you an A.  Everyone in our class made an A.  I made a %100.  Take her!\n",
            "COMP   - I had the pleasure of being in Nick Kenyeres class and I can honestly say that he is by far the best professor from my first semester classes! He's so helpful and humble. I got %100 in his class. He's very kind and fair in all his tests and assignments. I recommend him all the way!\n",
            "Moody is the man.He always helped me and guided me in my creative methods.  Art is90% perspiration and %10 inspiration, you work hard to get what you want. A teacher isn't supposed to do it for yah. He is an awesome teacher, disregard the earlier faux comments!!\n",
            "She is really great and wonderful. I had taken most of my classes with her, and I've learned a lot. %100 guarantee.\n",
            "Mr. Tonda is clear and helpful. He explains everything well and makes sure to answer all questions. He doesn't get off topic much. His tests are really easy, %50 from the review. Read the review and be there for the notes, you'll pass.\n",
            "I took his class this summer. By far he is the best professor I ever had. He is makes everything so easy to understand. You just have to make sure to take some notes and listen. I recommend him %100\n",
            "I took this class for easy gen ed credits, but it most definitely was not easy. Exams were worth %70 and memorising the entire textbook was necessary to do well. Not recommended.\n",
            "I LOVE MRS. WARD. She is a wonderful professor and she's very nice even in person. She helps a lot. she makes you think that you are smart, she stays with you and help, she teaches you how to work on a computer from the beginning. If you want to take a computer class and you ended up here, TAKE HER!! %100 Guaranteed A and understood lecture. \n",
            "Both   and   are liars, he way more difficult than they portray him. %50 of class received D's on midterm, who knows what happened on final  This guy should be fired.\n",

            "BRUTAL PROF! I am a smart student, I have never EVER had a prof make a course so hard! After our midterm with a class average of %40 50 people dropped out of 3 sections! 50 people! This brought the class average up but left many of us who were above class average on the midterm at the bottom of the class. He refused to scale it, calling us idiots!\n",
            "Teacher does not read anything you submit!  To test this theory I purposfully submitted and incorrect chapter and still recieved %100.  Did half @$$ job on mid-term project and recieved %100.  Man, I want his job!\n",
            "Not the most helpful, Easy thou and crystal clear if you read ahead of class. No homework but lots of reading. READ THE BOOK! You'll need it for the tests which consist of %81.8 of your grade the other %18.2 of your grade is a take home quiz; of which all together  / (% )that not including a easy(+%7)extra credit. Easy A if your shingon\n",
            "SHES EASY! just buy the book! so you are doing the reading she barely teach the class she likes to gossip with students. one of our classmate brought a movie to class and ended up watching it. just don't miss a class because attendance is %10 percent of your grade. shes easy but nice and helpful\n",

            "This is definitely an EASY A. Please take this class. You will enjoy is and learn a lot. The assignments are super easy. Open textbook on most tests. I think I literally got %100 in this class. She is a cool teacher.\n",
            "Although he was entertaining, I found it next to impossible to take notes from his lecture since he went on constant tangents and tirades.  I dropped the 4 week course out of fear of my grade being %50 based on lecture.\n",
            "good lecturer. watch a movie almost every class. NO HOMEWORK!!! you writing assignment are your notes. so you have to attend class which is also %50 of your grade. also any notes you take are on the test and u get to use you notes on the test. get an A on the first two tests and you no longer have to come to class or take the final. Easy A.\n",
            "Great proffessor always willing to listen and answer questions. A little bit hard to understand but overall a good professor, he really wants you to understand the class and is always %100 willing to help.\n",
            "She definitely has her favorites. As long as you participate in class and make sure that she agrees with the general idea of your paper, it will be an easy B. It will piss her off if you just fool around every day and %50 of your grade is on participation.\n",
            "For starters, the actual class material is a lot to handle if you are not dedicated. Dr Brown does know his subject extremely well, which sometimes may be overwhelming when trying to keep up in class. He does hint at what is on the exams (3 midterms 15%, final %25) The lab isn't too bad, though some major memorizing is needed before the practicals.\n",
            "There aren't enough words to express what an amazing teacher/person Laura is. She's funny and makes class fun and something to look forward to attending. She also helped me out a bit with a personal problem of mine, and wanted to make sure I knew she supported me %100. Easily my favorite teacher at Clark.\n",
            "This was an online class & it was horrible!  To date it was the most difficult class I've taken -avg on the final was %50!  More than 1/2 the people would have failed the class if he didn't curve.  Tests were ridiculously hard & the final cumulative - his justification, online means at least some people are cheating. Not to mention he's arrogant.\n",
            "Very quick at responding to emails. WHen the class didnt do well there was a huge curve (my grade went up %15 on midterm)Syllabus was hard to understand as well as the weird \"blue module\" thing he does. Class is highly recommended, do your discussion questions and be active on BB and you will get and A\n",
            "Tom has the best God-given insights and perspective on lit that I have ever seen! I've never had a professor teach lit from such an intriguing, often poignant, Christian perspective before. The class is %90 discussion from the reading, plus a few papers.\n",
            "Told one student he was trying to fail anyone who walked in late. Each quiz was worth %10 of your grade and some were unreasonable pop quizzes. Avoid at all costs\n",

            "Made material seem much harder than it is. Hours of homework per night that doesn't count at all and can only hurt you. Tests are long and worth %50 percent of your grade each. Teaches solely from powerpoints and lacks full examples.\n",
            "She is sometimes difficult to understand because of her accent. But I found her grading policy to be fair. 2 mid terms, both 20%. Fairly easy if you take notes and read. The two papers, %15 each, are more difficult. She grades very harsh, follow her instructions closely, ask for help, she'll give it.\n",
            "Extremely good professor. You don't need to take notes because he posts them online and then tells you in class which slides off his powerpoints will be tested. The 2 quizes aren't bad; %20 of grade. The 2 tests are easy; %40 of grade. 5 HW assignments all semester. One painless live court report. Very reasonable professor. Fun class!\n",
            "Easiest class I've taken at USI.  The woman speaks more slowly and clearly than anyone I've ever met. Tells you EVERYTHING to a T that you should focus on for the each of the 8 tests in the study guide.  I recieved a %100 on the final exam.  Put in a little effort on the memorization front and you will do great. We did not use the textbook at all.\n",
            "This class, math  taught by Evans was the easiest class of school I have ever taken in my life; including HS and elementary. I got over %100 on the first 2 tests and when I got a 96 on the third, I was upset with myself! Im not the best student too lol. TAKE HIM\n",
            "Cool guy, most lectures are pretty good, a boring one here and there. Multiple choice exams are difficult so do the readings. Essays make up %50 of the grade so you can still get a good grade if your not great multiple choice. Recommended if you enjoy history.\n",
            "Dr. Sample is the best professor I have ever had!  He is so caring and so insightful! I would recommend him %100.\n",
            "Floyd incorporates all of the students in class discussions, which is a definite plus.  She treats everyone with great respect.  Weekly quizzes are a little tricky, but you can bring notes most of the time.  Two papers = %50 grade.  Sweet deal.\n",
            "The nicest sweetest person I've ever met in my life. She always has %100 positive energy to give. Classes are not boring, she helps a lot. She won't be hard on you but she definitely cares. I wish I could take here class again. SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n",
            "Rob is so totally awesome! He rocks! He's funny, but you can tell that he means buisness. He's very down to earth, and very interested in you, and in helping you, as long as you are willing to put forth %100 in his class!\n",
            "I passed with an A. Out of 4 Hour exams, I failed 2 of them. one %100, and the last with a B. If you pay attention and do the homework your are assigned, the class is a breeze.

            "quirky but perceptive- it's really hard to get anything by this guy. Won't waste time with you if you're not ready to work. Also, your work is rarely ever approaches anything near complete which is good cause if you do %50 of the work in your professional life that you did for Bob, you'll be doin very well. Aufuldish is ego to Mike Fox's id...\n",
            "Chen's tests are difficult and very VERY SHORT. He only gives out two for the whole semester and they are one page double sided.  60% T/F and %40 on four short answers. 30% goes to attendance and pop quizzes. He also doesn't use a powerpoint to lecture and barely writes down anything that he takes about.  \n",
            "2nd half summer.  Clear, to the point, follows a power point and solves along.  Homework is on my math lab, must complete at least %70, not a tough grader.  4 take home \"exams\", turn in scantron and how you solved the work.  The final which is easier than the take home exams has 33 questions.  Study and you will get an A, participate to learn more.\n",
            "This class is so easy, especially if you take it with a friend. Sure she isnt so orginized. Pay attention on how she wants her maps done and you will get %100 every time. Also she gives you a study guide for each test. I hardly read the book. Just slightly pay attention in class and do your maps correctly and read alittle and you will get a easy A!\n",
            "Class dropout rate exceeded 50%  Failure rate on first midterm exceeded %50 of class.  No willingness to curve.  Crams too much into too little time.  Class comprehension was minimal going into exam.  Has extensive knowledge of subject but lacks teaching ability.  Worst Prof I've had in 5.5 years of University so far.\n",
            "Took Phil  /  with her (not sure why she's listed in eng dep). She's picked the most obscurantist philosophers in both classes. She marks hard and the material is next to impossible to understand \"if you understood %25 of Hegel, you're doing great.\" At that rate I can't imagine the grade curve. At least she uses all her textbooks, which are cheap, and she is friendly and approachable. I'm going to try to avoid her in the future though.\n",
            "Took for Macro Economics.  For a summer, short term session.  Obviously class was rushed.  I dont think i comprehended everything i wanted/expected to.  Only 3 tests, at %25 a piece, they are all really meaningful.  He was leinient tho and accepted suggestions for making tests and which sections to test on.  Would probably take another class with, \n",
            "I highly recommend professor Davenport. His class is all powerpoints with no online assignments. His notes are very helpful and can be used for the assignments he gives you. His test always match his reviews %100. If you study the review and know it you can pass this class for sure. Just be warned lots of info but put in the time and you'll be fine\n",
            "I'm not going to say anything about the quality of Prof. Schwartz, but merely issue a warning for anyone in the hard sciences: after sitting through two classes I heard a staggering amount of misinformation; for instance, he told the class that methane is \"highly\" toxic. He also expressed the view that technology fails %100 of the time.... o.O\n",
            "Ned's not a bad prof. He's nice and goofy, (not in the lame way). But the thing is, getting a 4.0 in his class is really effin difficult. With a midterm weighing 40% and a final weighing %60, you really can't afford to slip up even once. I had a 3.95 GPA but dropped 0.05 points after his class, which is depressing if you're anything like me.\n",
            "Professor Schneider by far is the easiest and sweetest professor I've ever had. If you want an A, SHOW UP to class. Do not miss more than 2 days and you guarantee for an A. Participation points are plentiful and so are extra credits ( %5 boost). She designed course materials so that it's very manageable. Her course was well-enjoyed.\n",
            "Stagecraft, she's the best. If you do what you say you will and work hard, the class is easy and fun. If not you're screwed. If you don't care about the class, don't take it because she is %100 serious. If you mess around she WILL talk bad about behind your back. And she hates the B-Building Smellies.\n",

            "The worst class I took in Business School was his International Accounting class.  Extremely boring, grades the case studies way to harshly.  Probably the most boring class I have taken in college.  Takes role everyday for %10 of your grade.  His tests are ridiculous in that your have to memorize everything from his lectures.\n",
            "Class is very repetitive and attendence is taken for %15 of your grade. Gets extremely boring. Lots of guest speakers. You basically read the book and learn the material yourself. What Brymer teaches you in class really isnt on the tests. He is a nice guy, but doesnt prepare you well for tests. He runs out of things to teach half way though the sem\n",
            "Total tool. However, if you're a sycophant you might like him and vice versa. Again, %100 tool.\n",
            "Professor Rohman was a VERY easy teacher. Maybe he went easy on my class since it was just Honors Seminar, but he was not a tough grader at all. He is not very exciting and his sense of humor is sort of dry, but he's very nice and helpful and I kid you not, my final grade was literally over %100. So I would recommend him for a stress free class.\n",
            "Homework took hours and hours of effort and could not be completed unless you got help.\r Midterms were long and hard.\r And if you expected to be given some slack on the final Ha! Expect marks in the %30 range.\n",
            "im sorry, but if you can't get an A in his class, you must be dumb as a rock. If your looking for something to learn, well...hes not what we call, chalk full of information. but if your looking for some credits and a good grade, take this class %100. hes a good guy at heart--great to talk to--just a bit of a space case!\n",
            "Great professor! Make sure you read every day as there are 10 quizzes of 1-2 questions worth %20 of your grade! Very helpful and he knows this stuff like crazy! One of my favorite professor so far. Not the easiest class but you learn a lot. Just make sure you come to class prepared and participate, he can add up to 5% on your grade at the end!\n",
            "Really interesting but easy class if work is done. You have two research assignments, a midterm, a final, and 8 cases. The cases are worth only %10 of your grade so as long as you keep up with the work you should get a good grades. Exams are closely based on the review guide, and follow what he taught in class. Highly recommend taking him.\n",
            "He is a really nice guy and truly cares about his students success.  However, he gives TONS of work.  You are doing something for this class almost every week.  Also, his test questions are hard to understand.  On the good side, the tests only account for %30 of your grade, so if you do well on the other assignments, you can get an A.\n",
            "He is nice, but not a good teacher. The way he grades doesn't make any sence; he says he grades how well I think you do in the class only he doesnt give many assingments and he never learned any ones names. The class 90% his opinions of the world and %10 english. If you want an easy pass, yes; if you want a earned grade and to learn, no.\n",
            "It cannot be true that %80 of people fail this class. His accent was cute at first, and now it's just irritating and a little arrogant. Don't tell me to put the newspaper away; I finished this proof 20 minutes ago. And get some TAs that actually care if I show up.\n",
            "I got a good mark in class but I found him extremely mean and confusing.  I got %100 on my first project and then he gave me %70 on my next one\n",
            "Took ENGL  . Decent prof overall. Has big self-esteem issues. Papers will usually get good grades if they are unique. In class discussions. He genuinely wants to help you. Problem is he's moody. My first paper 90%, second paper 100%, third paper %64. No reason for it, I wrote it the same way, and 25% of my grade was on that.\n",
            "i had him at SCCC in brentwood. this guy is on major power trip. students average in this class were around a c- grading was absolute horrible.his final test was worth 10 % of final grade. quizes %50 and is gay question he ask in class 40% and this is how he fails you. the kids he likes he will give the points 2when he asks them questions from text\n",
            "No OPEN BOOK EXAM , she changed her style amd it is completely diffrent than all below reviews. Hard exam and hard lab quiz which the average are %60. Dont take her , go somewhere else if you are a good listener. Half of class dropped before exam 4\n",
            "Only class i have ever failed my whole life. He gave me a 1.0, but i probably had a %45. His tests were rediculous, had nothing to do with what he lectured on. I think he borrowed  another teachers test becuz it was diff info. I had to teach myself cuz he went to fast, and u cant teach urself organic chem very easily.\n",
            "Her on-line course is well organized but she doesn't exactly have an open door policy for students who have questions and need help. Overall, her announcements had a tone of frustration and if you had a question her response was usually to figure it out on your own. Also, having a %90 in her course is a B as only 92% or higher is an A.\n",
            "conceptual learning means conceptual tests.  IT was a hard class HOWEVER, he does a review and in it goes over %95 of the test, so you know what to study for.  He likes to do definition pop quizzes.  DOES NOT use black board which means you have to email him for test results or wait until the following class.\n",
            "He encourages students to be creative. His problem solving class is WAY easy at first, then gets tougher halfway in. Show %100 of your work or else you get marked down. Problems are usually a page write-up each, however, you ONLY have 5 a week! Keep up by doing 1 per weekday and u'll get an A or B!\n",
            "She's sharp as a tack.  Her tangents on teaching are hilarious and makes you want to listen in class.  One time she spent %45 of the class talking about Confucious.\n",
            "Online class. Overall very easy. Most answers to the work are given to you with the software so you literally can't hand in the homework with out %100. Other assignments are automatically graded with %100 just for handing it in. This applies to everything, but the tests which are all really easy. She doesn't communicate much with the class, though.\n",
            "Great Professor can't complain, 4 Journals, Nice teacher explains everything simple, Moves slow on Chapters only covered couple Chapters throughout the Semister. 1 Research Paper on any topic u want which is %40 of your grade. Simple class that you may enjoy and learn something.\n",
            "Vague and will fry you. Class can be much easier, If we get midterm revisions. That's alot of material for 2 classes a week, %90 of the class is Arduino even though most of us requested to focus on C++ programming. The average median score for class is a \"D\". No phones before  and after testing. You can't take your exams home after being corrected.\n",
            "Still taking Jason this spring quarter and could not wait to rate him.  MATH at OSU sucks!!  This is the second time taking the class and I understand precalc way beyond imaginable!  First midterm was a 70 last quarter.  I got a 96 through him. If you are clueless in math, TAKE HIM.  he makes it to where you will understand %100.  He needs a raise!\n",
            "He is a good teacher  but always pushes his students hard.If you cant maintain %75 he forces you to drop the class.End of the semester there were only 12 students in the class.By the way, he swears too.\n",
            "Yes he's not the best teacher around... His lectures aren't very useful BUT, you can get great grades as long as you read the text book, do practice exams, do the hw, and study. You can't expect to go to a lecture and learn/ consolidate everything %100, READ THE TEXT BOOK, it's the best teacher there is.\n",
            "Karla will take time after or before class to help you, She make the class fun and sometimes gives the class an option to chose the next lesson. the dances are a bit fast but if you ask her to review the steps for you she will. Best class on campus Amazing professor would take this class again %100. Or just volunteer to be in the class again. 3\n",
            "Karla will take time after or before class to help you, tries to make everyday fun and will sometimes ask the class what they would like to do for the next lesson.

            "I took for SPN   + SPN  . She is a good teacher, but she moves VERY fast, I had a hard time understanding her and keeping up. You must study (or at least understand what you covered) after every class to get a good grade. She is big on participation (come to class) and pop quizes. We took 8 or 10 each semester, and drop 3. 3 tests are %45 of \n",
            "Class was easy if you were on top of your homework in Aleks. I ended up with all %100 on the 4 tests\n",
            "It's pretty simple: 1. Think  2. Work on the homework 3. Care about the topics at hand and participate 4. Take down ALL the notes. After you do all that, expect an A. I only needed to get a %20 on the final to still have an A!\n",
            "Dyck is very nice in person but this course is something like Philosophy you either get it or you don't. If you are a fast and excellent writer then you'll do fine. Tests are all written 3 short ans worth 10% each then 2 longer answers worth 30% each. The final paper was %30 on what you learned in the course max   words but he varies it each sem.\n",
            "Horrible Horrible Horrible. Gives practically no credit on test with answers that are not %100 correct. Avoid this class at all costs!!\n",
            "The man is awesome. He's a great guy just to listen to because he is so funny and involved with his class. Sometimes he talks about a subject like his students have a PhD themselves, which can be confusing. His tests aren't too bad, concert reviews are %100 everytime and he lets you use your text book to take his online quizzes\n",
            "Professor Darby was a fantastic lecturer. He makes you learn. His repetition of important terms makes you realize themes and ideas in the readings that you never saw before. His course actually made me think more carefully about the things we take for granted in our world.  %30 grade was tutorial participation %30 final essay %40 final exam\n",
            "Write down and study everything he goes over in the notes and you will end up with a %100. He gives you absolutely everything you need in this course. If you don't make an A, it's your fault.\n",
            "This class sucks. Welcome to weed-out Engineering. Online homework was the bane of my existence. His tests were %80 multiple choice, and they were moderately difficult. Find some old tests and hope for the best.\n",
            "He's full of himself, but not too condesending to his students. His class is %100 essay, so you actually need to get the book. His lectures are very detailed, so showing up every day is highly recommended. This class is not for slackers. On the up-side, I'm not at all a fan of history and he's even got me interested.\n",
            "An easy A. you have to be comfortable with writing essays.. take notes %90 percent of the finals and tests is off of the notes. Attendance is important too. fun class !! go to his office hours, that would help a lot.....\n",
            "Extremely easy. I got a %100, literally. Attendance is worth 30% of your grade, so make sure you show up and are on time. She isn't the most knowledgeable, and the material is mostly assessed on the surface, but it wasn't a bad class at all.\n",
            "Very very kind and knowledgeable instructor. He gives lots of examples in the class that can help you with tests. Always ready to help his students. %100 Recommended.\n",
            "This is undoubtedly the best math teacher i have ever had. I am telling you, there is a special spot in heaven for this man...His teaching is clear, quized %100 accurate, and he doesnt tamper w/ the material, hard chpt =hard quiz easy chapter =easy quiz. period. i wish he taught everything. If you fail, its bcus u didnt listen and didnt study.\n",
            "You can be apart of psych studies and gain an extra easy %4. My course was half online and you do have to read a lot of content that is not covered in his lectures which is okay. There are some questions on his tests that are a little tricky. There are two midterms and a final. All not cumulative so each exam has less than three chapters.\n",
            "He is the worst educator I have ever had or heard of. The case book and his classes are completely %100 useless. For the love of god trust me on this: The ONLY..., I repeat, the ONLY thing you need to study are his Silver Bullets and the \"optional\" Dressler Hornbook. His exam questions will ask \"in Dressler\" not in my class or in the casebook.\n",
            "Math is by far my worse subject. I passed her class with a B and got a %100 on my final. By far one of the BEST teachers at PBCC. She is absolutely amazing and wants nothing but the best for her students. She will stop her entire day to make sure you fully understand what shes teaching. If only every teacher at PBCC was like this. TAKE HER!!!\n",
            "He has favorites, but the students he likes are the ones that show up, and turn in work on time. He's a facinating man who really wants to help, you just have to ask and he'll go to bat for a student %100. Only take the class if you're interesting in playwriting, otherwise he will bore you to tears.\n",

But besides that, he moves really fast & is very rude. but w/e...i got a B so who cares\n",
            "Oh God. This whole semester I did not uderstand a word he said. He doesn't teac you anything at all and on the test he expects you to know everything. For example, the last test that we took, only 5 people out of 18 passes the test. what is that %25 passing rate! IF YOU NEED TO PASS THIS CLASS, DO NOT TAKE HIM. DO NOT TAKE HIM. NO-NO-NO. HE SUCKS\n",
            "TAK can be a funny and nice guy at times, but he has the shortest temper of any professor I have ever had. Lab exams have a practical part where you need to do the experiment and they can be extremely difficult when you are timed. He did curve the final lab grade for my lab section, I ended up with an %85. Overall, would not take him again.\n",
            "He is a nice guy, knows his stuff and helps you learn the matterial. He works on his easy handouts only, no HW, 3 tests, easy, but has 10-11 questions (which I hate these kind of testing) plus a final with a value of %40 of your grade. I got %100 in his final and an A overall. I recommend him.\n",

Three midterms but will drop the lowest. Final is mandatory. Gives like 100 points for EC out of  , so it should be easy to get an A.\n",
            "not that difficult, just alot of hard work.  he expects %100.  also a toug grader.  but worth it.  hold very interesting classes and i learned alot.  as long as you do the work and make an effort, you will do well.\n",
            "Very inexperienced, stubborn, and narrow-minded when it comes to teaching the violin. I have to mention that she is a fine and honest person, but you wouldn't want her to teach you more than 6 months; hopefully after that period you woudl still have %10 of your sound, physical health, and mental stanility left to go and find another teacher.\n",
            "Easy A.. Make sure you do well on Quizzes and HM and projects and open your eyes for the practice test that he gives you b4 the test. %99.91 are the same test.\n",
            "Mr. Gay is smart but he has no idea how to teach. Seriously. He relies %100 on a website for you to do the homework on so he doesn't have to grade anything. And he expects every student to teach them selves everything. If you are a good book learner, go for it. If you need a person to actually teach you material, this is NOT the teacher for you.\n",
            "I found this class very easy. I have never opened the textbook and I stopped going to the lectures after the first exam. The TA explains everything you need to know. However the exams can be pretty tricky but he gives a %5 curve on each exam. I still managed to get an A in the class. Recommend!!\n",

            "Tests are tough, avg of the first test was 38% and the next was %62, curves the tests but obviously the material doesn't sink in. Doesn't go over hw problems before assigning the homework. He's a kind, helpful man, but it's a challenging/frustrating class. Actually have to read the textbook and do the problems repetitively to understand material.\n",
            "By far the worst teacher I've had at Clemson. The tests are pointless and the information is boring stats that you will never ever use again. Attendance is also mandatory and every class you miss he deducts %5 from your grade... STAY FAR AWAY FROM KIP\n",
            "Homework every Wednesday. Quiz every Friday. Lab every Monday. Fair quizzes, hard midterms, harder final. Homework can sometimes be hard, too! Midterm class average was %60.\n",
            "Go to class and take notes and do the in class assignments. She's very passionate about the subject and gives study guides that tells exactly what is going to be on the exams.  Easy A, I ended the class with over %100. I suggest she goes on What not to wear though.\n",
            "Professor Phinney was great. Unless you absolutely didn't care or don't do any work in his class you will pass. There is plenty of extra credit to complete if you miss an assignment. The grading was simple and clear. Textbook is included as well. I would %100 recommend him to anyone.\n",
            "He is a really good prof. He really knows his stuff. Come to class because he gives out pop quizzes. Like the other reviewers said, he says um and uh a lot. Try not to fall behind on lab work (which is really easy). He does give amnesties for the Labs (but at a %50 penalty). His midterms are pretty lengthy, be prepared for at least an hour.\n",
            "Professor is terriable. Avoid her at all costs. The notes that she gives on the board are irrelevent to the hw.  This professor might know alot but she does not know how to teach.  The average on her tests are %40.\n",
            "Honestly one of the hardest classes I have ever taking. She gave me a %6 on the first test. After studying and feeling really confident I got a %55 on the third test. I would not recommend her to anyone who inst already awesome at math. She makes fun of you when you ask questions in class. Also no calculators are allowed.\n",
            "Thinks he is god's gift to political science. %60 of the class is spent on him talking about the people he knows and the jobs he held in politics. The study guides are at least 4 pages long.Class was almost afraid to answer his questions, no right answers\n",
            "He tends to go off track sometimes during lectures, but his class is easy. Tests are allowed double sided cheat sheets, and he gives you practice tests that he'll pull answers from for the real test. Also, he'll help you %100 of the way with the project, there's no reason to not Ace it. You can get extra credit if you've less than 4 absences\n",
            "Prof. Halaka is the best prof you can ever imagine. She's very kind, caring & repeats each day's HW,& Tests on the board so students learn more. Although she is in her 50s, she has a lot of energy & patience for students. I TRULY Recommend Her to anyone, you'll Pass the class %99. Took her for 81 & 84 Got B & A, I wish she was teaching 31 & 20 too.\n",
            "Very harsh on grades with zero feedback on what you did wrong. Never teaches anything. Zero clear information on anything. Doesn't help when you're confused and is in the room %5 of the time in class. \n",
            "Nothing he says is on any of the tests. Loves to go on tangents about himself and the life he has, most of his lectures are about %10 related to the topic at hand. Lectures are mostly about random things and people in history. Learned more about his life than I did about history. If you are trying to learn about American History I do not recommend \n",
            "This teacher is really bad and shouldn't be allowed to teach. One homework can take hours or even days to do. He fails %60 of every class. He'll give you 100's of things to memorize for the test and pick one thing out of it all to concentrate on. He pretends to care but doesn't. His group work is also bad. Don't take his class!\n",
            "She shows a hefty liberal bias in lectures. Very easy class. 5 total extra credit very possible, and 10% added via easy, easy pair of quizzes. 1st test was curved %8 pts and the next ones were about %4. Went to half of sessions and aced it. Study guide given for test - know that and your golden. She was extremely nice.\n",
            "Kintzle knows what he's talking about but he doesn't actually teach anything.  His methods for instruction are extremely outdated, and the textbook he uses is impossible to read.

            "Avoid at all costs. After the first exam he came to class after giving %95 of the class a C+ or worse and said that it was ok because he had very few above average students. He goes into this class thinking no one will do well.\n",
            "Somewhat ok during his lectures, he laughs at his own jokes. I took this class for college credit. Needless to say I have a Real Estate license  and somehow I never received a grade higher than %74 on any of his test. How does that happen?? Trust me their is a disconnect between his lectures, the material, and his test.\n",
            "This is a very good pro. I didn't do much in his class and I passed it. If he sees that you are trying to put the effort to pass, he'll pass you %100 sure. Just do the assignments and you'll pass the class.\n",
            "The only one good thing about him which makes students pass his class is that his C is from %60-%79. He does not explain concepts. All he does is doing examples in class that is not as hard as the tests. Half of his test questions is from the homework problems that he would not even check if you have them right or not.\n",
            "This class was EASY!  Here's what you need to do for an A: show up to each class, do a presentation sometime during the semester, do the weekly homework (it takes 20 minutes or less), and take the easy easy final (I got %100 with no studying).  Oh, and did I mention how incredibly hot she is  If she weren't a professor she could be a supermodel.\n",
            "He wants you to work very hard for the exams. Exams %70, Labs %25 and homeworks are %5 effective on final grade. Everyone scored poorly on first exam then people started complaining and dropping the class. He changed his mind and started making questions rather easy. he decided to drop the lowest exam score. After these changes classbecame better\n",
            "1)she is passionate about animals. 2)this makes her very, very, very bias on every.single.topic. 3)does not know how to teach. recites off an oldschool projector. when deviates from that format she rambles about nonsensical or personal matters(4)textbook is only useful for %30 of each midterm(5)bad at teaching, good at thinking. don't take her\n",

She is very nice but a nasty when it comes to grading and testing. which is what should matter any ways. I could care less if she is nice. She is not a good teacher\n",
            "It doesnt matter if 80% is an A, or %50 is a pass, if you dont know chemistry, or if you did not have any recent prior experience, youll FAIL. Maintaining a %50 is difficult without appropriate guidance and this teacher does not provide that (yet its an intro class). Frankly, his ratings are based on a consensus and in my experience, its accurate.\n",
            "I had Ann Williamson for almost %75 of all my classes, she is the main teacher for the Early Childhood Program. That's the program I just graduated from, overall Ann is a awesome teacher. She's very friendly and easy to get along with. There is homework but as long as you try your hardest you'll do just fine. I can't find anything really wrong.\n",
            "If you don't get an A in this class... you don't deserve to be in college. All you have to do is study the practice exams at the end of each chapter. Those are the tesst! He curves the test scores too: my lowest score on the tests was a %98.5. Take this class. EASY A.\n",
            "HORRIBLE. he is rude and condenscending.Beyond senile. Constantly brought up VA tech.Is unapproachable and unwilling to work with students.All we did was watch movies;from about  . Doesnt cover %90 of the material thats on the exams but expects you to show up to class.Insane amounts of reading with no guidance as to what to study 4. AVOID!!!!\n",
            "i really love this prof. He teaches u the stuff that u need. I see him really easy and the materials are not hard if u go to class & just pay %30 of ur attention. i made an A in this class and i'm not great at states. Just one thing, keep going to class. I'n not sure if he still in school or not, cause he left us after 2nd exam. Highly recommended\n",
            "Rambles.  You never know when she's teaching (which isnt very frequently).  On the bright side theres no reason to go to her class cuz participation is worth %5 and u can do %10 of extra credit with one 3 page paper.  guess which is easier\n",
            "I had my paper read by everyone i know, including the writing lab twice. She still gave me a %54!!!! The writing lab said it was a for sure B!!! She is a horrible teacher, Never gives you clear assigments!! You are automatically supposed to know what she wants. I am not just mad beacause of my grade, really avoid this teacher,Sweet lady,bad teacher\n",
            "Boring lecturer and really hard exams. Class average for first exam was %36. He's more helpful in recitation, but you have to get the problem completely right to get any credit. Mess up a sign and lose most of the points on a problem. Avoid if you can.\n",
            "An excellent professor. Engaging, loves his students and is hilarious. Let's you retake the midterm if you get under an %80!\n",
            "This teacher expects a LOT of work, but she will put in %100 to help you do well.  Not an easy course, but worth taking.  You will definately learn a lot.  Slackers beware !\n",
            "She spends about %70 of class time talking about her family and her past! Good luck when finals come!\n",
            "A bit disorganized. Late for class which I didn't mind. One of the assignments was 10 years old or so. There's always errors in his links, didn't fix them quickly or even notice. I mostly got higher grades than expected. Eventually got the letter I deserved. Midterm was %50 from the study guide, final %0. Easy grader, always check after him\n",
            "if you have a choice, do not take this class.  i get perfect grades on the homeworks, but the exams are another story (& %75 of overall grade).  practice exams are deceptively mild.  often writes gibberish on his overhead projector, but never notices that he is writing on the cieling or some kind of fixture anyway and nobody can see it.\n",
            "DMK was an old school drama teacher.  The kind that smoked and drank coffee during class and turned out some of Canada's finest talents beccause she wouldn't accept the trashy, non-committal stuff students tried to give her.  DMK was all heart and soul and acting.  A genius in my experience. She didn't want anyone to be Olivier, just give %100.\n",
            "Even though she is very confusing and insane when you first meet her, she does know her stuff. Just be really patient with her and you'll learn a lot from her. Do you work and the diary she keeps mentioning. Artist research is vital. The diary is %60 of your grade.\n",
            "Dr. G is a great lady. By far the nicest, most helpful professor I have ever met.  However, MCB   is a LOT of work.  I found the tests to be hard and intimidating because they were long and free response.  But, the lab work is about %60 of your grade, which helped me pull off an A-.  It is important to do very well on the labs in this class!\n",
            "Going to her class is a joke, she speaks gibberish and is a poor lecturer. The tests are difficult and most people average a %60-70. The only saving grace is that the homework accounts for a majority of your grade so as long as you do the homework you should do okay in the class\n",
            "Lectures a little dry at times , but he does a good job diagramming and explaining what you need to know. he reviews the concepts that are on the exams. 9 HW's worth %10 of grade. Very nice exam curves also! Not the easiest of classes, but with some work, its not bad. Don't hesitate to see him at his office, he is very approachable and nice.\n",
            "Had her for intro PSYC. her tests were beyond hard, but an excellent 1st yr class, cause it forces u to mature. for the first two test, i got %50 (class average), but after beginnin to study earlier, got +80% on the last 3! makes u feel proud after! ^^\n",
            "it is hard to tell when hes moving on to a new subject, but he goes over all the info.  Hes really nice and understands that school isnt the only thing in life.  If you listen and follow the slides  you shouldnt have a problem. Im a psych major( have senioritis) and i still got an A putting in about %50 effort\n",
            "This teacher is easily the worst physics teacher I've had, and possibly the worst teacher I have had. He tests on stuff not covered in lecture or in the book. After about 2 weeks, everyone realizes how bad his lectures are and attendance drops to %50, which shows how horrible he is at teaching. I love physics, but this teacher is really poor.\n",
            "Mr. K is hilarious, fun,and gives examples to help you understand. He doesn't always keep you the whole time and he gets the point across. His multiple choice tests are hard but he gives essay questions take home worth %50 of test. Subject can get boring but he makes it fun.Overall, hes the best and funniest prof i ever had!!\n",
            "It was an online course so I never dealt with him in person. Once I emailed about a missed question on a test and he was exceptionally rude. The semester grade was based off 5 online tests each with 20 questions and 20 mins to complete. Each question = %1 of semester grade. Some questions were misleading and unfair. Still got an A though.\n",
            "I took calcules 1 with this profesor. After two weeks from the begining of the semester, almsolt %75 of the students dropped the course. I did'nt drop. By the time we got to finals there were only 7 students in the class. I got a C+ on this class (my gpa is 3.8) so please dont even think about taking this professor. please!!\n",
            "More than half of her class failed because she graded roughly by %92+ got an A, ... %70-75 got a D, and anything lower than that was an F. She also made very cold, harsh comments.\n",
            "Dr. Cavaiani reads from PPoint slides all period long, and expects his students to become programmers. The fail rate for this class is rumored to be around %70, and its easy to see why with such unmotivated instruction. Buy the book and find someone who has taken the class in order to fill the gaping holes Cavaiani creates.\n",
            "Had him for Int. Alg., and Pre-Calc. I like his teaching style, and test's aren't too bad. %80 test %20 take home + 12 exra credit points available. He goes over each kind of problem from the homework in class, and tells you what is going to be on the test. Just study and you'll do fine. **The Student Solutions Manual and Interact Math help a lot!\n",
            "If you suffer from text anxiety, I strongly urge you to no take this class. Each of his online quizzes give you 30 seconds to answer each question, and the fill in the blank portions are impossibly specific. Not to mention, the quizzes count for %50 of your grade. It's horribly stressful, unnecessarily so for a freshman class.\n",
            "If you decide to take this class,look forward to an extremely unfair workload;(12,000+ words) semester writing assignments+ chapter questions+ weekly article presentations..All of this accounts for %30 of your grade.The other %70 percent is weighted in his ridiculously graded exams.Really nice guy but senility is on the horizon, you've been warned.\n"

            "He doesn't teach the material and doesn't review for the exams he gives. You would be better off taking a different professor. I read the books and studied nonstop and still only scraped a C. I aced the lab portion of it, and that was the reason for the C. I aced microbiology and A&P before I even took his class. Find someone else.\n",
            "I took this professor for Biology  . I looked up which professor to take for my A&P class and when his name popped up, it gave me a flash of PTSD. His lectures had absolutely nothing to do with the materials on the tests. I could have skipped the whole semester, read the textbook by myself and could have gotten the same grade as I received.\n",
            "Do you really need to pass your a&p with a good grade after so much effort? Then do yourself a favor by not taking the class with him. Please, please and please, make a good decision from the beginning so that you dont have to regret at the end. I told you.\n",
            "I took this class straight out of high school. I managed to pull a B, but worked liked a dog to get it. FInd another professor. You will regret taking him unless ur willing to devote ur life to A&P. GET THE HECK OUT. TRUST ME. I had nightmares about this classs.I wish I knew about ratemyprof. back then. Avoid this guy at all costs.\n",
            "Dr. B. is all about her students. She goes above and beyond to help us land jobs. Her acting classes are amazing. She is the heart of the theatre program at E&H.\n",
            "I had Shirley for A&P I and II.  She is a nice professor  A little monotone.  She will answer any questions you have.  The material is hard and her tests are NOT easy.  The true/false are often written very confusingly.  Over all a good teacher.\n",
            "Reacting Class; Must speak at every class pretty much sometimes your role sucks. However, as long as you say your piece&participate youre ok. 2 writing assignments per game (3 games in all)& a final. Fair grading&the class itself can get really intense. really nice lady. DO NOT BE THE BRITISH GOVERNORS GENERAL IN THE INDIA GAME.\n",
            "Hard, but fair. You have to actually come to class, do all the reading, and memorize hundreds of body parts and their functions. Imagine that, in an A&P class! Dr. Hicks is definitly putting out pre-medical students who will one day know where their patient's body parts are.\n",
            "Mostly easy online tests, plus one brutally-graded read&write-paper. Not a particularly interesting teacher, but not dull either. Textbook reading is not completely necessary as very, very few questions are taken from it.\n",
            "Took her web-based In&Soc. class. Big mistake.\n",
            "He sucks! not helpful at all all he does is read the book in the class. if you ask him a question that is not from the book he would tell you to ask a specialist. so I dont know how he got to teach the class. very unhelpful and the tests suck you sould be happy if you get a C in the class unless you spend days&nights studying accounting\n",
            "Dr. P is wonderful!!!  He supplies his own notes- $6. No need for text book. Just read his notes, study his notes, take notes in class, pay attention, go to class, go to his lab and you should make an A. I loved him and begged him to teach A&P this fall.  He is always very willing to chat with you after class if you need some assistance.\n",
            "I took him for A&p 1 and 2 for one I had a amazing SI teacher and two that girl never showed up for SI..  Be prepared not to have a life  procrastination is not an option while other classes you can read a bite and pass Barnes makes it to where studying once or twice isn't enough you must look over this stuff at least 4 times a week to pass\n",
            "Dr. Barnes is an excellent instructor. He knows science in and out. His lectures are long and sometimes interesting. He's sarcastic as hell but I thinks it because you should know A&P 1 material before coming to A&P 2. I received a C because I chose not to study. If you study you will do fine. There is also SI classes before actual class that helps\n",
            "Took him for both A&P 1&2. For A&P1 he was great because he is funny and a great ice breaker of a professor. He's test are incredibly hard. Also during A&P2 he has quizzes that are formatted like his test. However, his grading system is formatted in a way that allowed me to make 5&6 out of 10 on the quizzes and 2 Ds on tests, but still pulled a B.\n",
            "Dr. Barnes is an excellent teacher! I am taking him for A&P 1. His lectures are based off of detailed powerpoint slides; the important information you need to know will be in red. However, only about 80% of what is highlighted in red is on the test, So if it is on the slide, it is fair game. Study the material in depth!! Loved him! Great teacher!!!\n",
            "A&P 1 was hard for me considering my father had just passed away. I made notecards and read the chapters. The only help I got from him was that I either didn't study enough or didn't comprehend the material. I would highly recommend taking another professor.\n",
            "Had him for A&P and it was horrible...He reads straight from powerpoints and tells you that info will be on the test, its NOT! You will have to know ALL the info from the book and the powerpoints just to make it thru...DO NOT TAKE DR. BARNES\n",
            "Good prof. Class is straight forward if you pay attention. What he lectures is on the test. No more. Essay format tough, but easy enough if you study.  Would highly recommend for A&P.  You will learn the material.\n",
            "He's a very exellent teacher. I would recomend him to anyone who want's to take A&P\n",
            "Anyone who is in anyway intimidated from A&P should take his class. He is a great teacher and makes everything easy to understand.\n",
            "Taking him for A&P I.  He is really smart but doesn't explain clearly.  He doesn't allow questions to be asked during the lecture, only in the very beginning or the very end.  This is useless because he's already gone through the entire lecture.  He doesn't give points for the lab reports.\n",

He makes each subject covered as easy as possible to comprehend but is not an easy A unless you read and write good notes.  I took him for both A&P 1 and 2 and would recommend him if you want to learn anatomy in its simplest form!\n",
            "he seems like a down to earth type of professor who makes his teachings and class times enjoyable to be in.I find myself interested in his lectures.i am glad to be able to have been instructed by someone like him who shows interest in different generations&allows others to feel as though he TRULY understands the experiences students are experiences\n",
            "I took (PSY 061) as an summer online course. I am really happy I decided to take this class! Prof Chaiken was wonderful! Assignments relatively easy if you put in some effort&she always had great feedback. I would recommend this course and I would take another one of her classes! I still had time to enjoy my summer and I still received an A!\n",
            "I cannot belive they let this man call himself a professor. He has completely wasted what could have been such an interesting class! He is lazy, and does not care at all about teaching. If I wasn't so set on graduating this Dec, I would honestly take M&A over again. It is too bad, I just learned of this website. Kudos to RMP.com for creating this..\n",
            "Kill me twice, I would hate to take this class again. I was taking StatsII and Lab&Stats at the same time, but somehow this was a lot harder. Classes were hard to pay attention, too. I like that we have multiple chances on the hw&quiz and she's nice enough to try to help you try to succeed in the class. I just wouldn't want to take it again.\n",

            "She is AMAZING!My favorite class so far!Yes,she seems intimidating at first but she's really awesome.She really does care.The class takes work&it's not an easy A but definitely worth it,I learned in that class not like others.1 long paper and 2 t/f multiple choice tests.I was 1 of 2 freshmen in the class w/upperclassmen&we passed so it's possible.\n",
            "intelligent,interesting,an amazing professor&person.very informative&always available,if a student actually tries to contact her.best advice READ,READ! yeah so she had some personal issues this semester..but who doesn't be more understanding,at least shes honest&adjusted the schedule for the class!\n",
            "I needed this class to graduate from Texas A&M University.  I withdrew from it at Texas A&M and came home for the summer to try and take it. The class moved very fast and I did get lost but Mr.Richardson helped me so much. He let me retake a couple exams and he helped me anytime I had a question. He was awesome!\n",
            "Dr.Hallock is the best teacher she's so nice&makes history interesting because she teaches like shes telling a story&make you want to know more. She is very understanding&lenient. If I need to take another history class I would def take it with her again!\n",
            "A complete sweetheart, and very friendly and understanding if you're willing to talk to her. Fairly easy class as long as you show up, pay attention to what she's saying, and do your work correctly&on time. She does speak a bit fast, but if you ask, she's always more than willing to explain it again for you. Very knowledgeable, take her if you can!\n",
            "Lenson Rocks like Crack! Who but Lenson would speak at Extravaganja, let me do Poetry and photography for my papers, and talk about S&M the day I bring my little sister... I still need to figure out how to get high with him... Ha!\n",
            "Horan clearly is an expert on the subject of M&A, but doesn't really impart enough of his wisdom.  I was really excited for this class, but didn't learn too much more than I could have on my own.  Easy A or B+ if that's your objective, but don't come out of it expecting to know much about doing any major deals.  The textbook is terrible, too.\n",
            "I recommend this professor for this class. She was always available when help was needed. Our final research project was graded lightly considering we had less time to conduct research compared to other classes. I learned a lot in this class. Made class interesting with hands on learning like probability testing with M&Ms. Definitely recommend her!\n",
            "Wonderful and very pleasant.Took her class last semester and taking it again.Give moderate amount of work but what do you expect for college.Essays are hand written which is good when practicing timing for the exit exam.Will work with you;VERY&TOO understanding so DON'T take her for granted. Helpful and sine have improved in my writing skills :)\n",
            "OMG!! His class was HARD and CHALLENGING. You will leave his class cursing every time. He will read the 1st sentence (the lead) and give you an F if its not right&wont matter about the rest of paper.BUT when u PASS his class u will feel like u've  won gold medal. He is hard but he WILL make you a better writer. Paper every week. 2 tests. Need book.\n",
            "great teacher, she sends you her power points which are a life saver when studying for tests and lab practicles, very helpful, i heards a&p was a nightmare but with her it was fun. you need to study to pass but with every science corse you need to study. she prepares you for a&p2 very well. aslo very understanding if you need to miss a class.\n",
            "Dr. Lodato was a wonderful teacher! I had heard horror stories about A&P, but with Dr. L it was actually fun! She really cares about your well being, and wants you to to do well. She is very clear in her teaching and expectations of her students. I learned a TON of information, but never felt overloaded. As long as you study you can get an A!\n",
            "Good Lecturer, well educated, seems to really care about students learning the material. She designs her tests to be as easy as possible.  Dr. L is good humored and easy to approach. A&P is a lot of material, take her but dont think you will get by without reading the chapters.  Also, there are three really hot girls in my class. :)\n",
            "Unfortunately the curriculum of this class was bad enough that I contemplated on going to the dean about it. Shes a great person fun to talk to but 1) your grade is entirely based of 3 exams 2) no hw to count towards grades that re enforce lecture 3) exams can be up to 14 chapters worth of info I reccomend taking A&P before taking this class\n",
            "Contrary to A&P, her pathophysiology class is somewhat difficult because she makes it so. Encourages class partucipation,but tries to prove everyone wrong. Seems self righteous and does not like to be challenged by students. Provides you with 10pt. test essays, however does not go over these in class, expects you to know from A&P! Avoid NOT hot!\n",
            "I have had Theresa for 2 different classes (cell bio and A&P1); she is not to hard but she does make you think. She will do whatever she needs to, to make sure you get it. She teaches her classes relating the content to everyday things that you can relate to and remember. Would highly recommend!\n",
            "Don't take class if you want to actually learn Teaches more history than A&P Goes off topic more often than not Gives assignments in class so show up Easy grader Uses textbook sometimes I would NOT recommend\n",
            "Professor Cosgrove is a wonderful educator and extremely knowledgeable in art history.  In my opinion she could be teaching at UCLA, Columbia or Harvard, very intelligent and articulate. Prof.Cosgrove does not tolerate impolite or disinterested students,which makes learning better&more enjoyable for students interested in learning;kind&senseofhumor\n",
            "If you can get away with taking this  instead of BIO  , do it; it is definitely easier (I've taken both). That being said, this class is a pain. The lectures are boring and are always at 8am, and the tests are really hard unless you are really good at memorizing the mastering A&P. \n"

            "She gives u the exam questions to study for,and you study hard, go to the exam hall , look at the exam questions, answer all of the questions THINKING that ull atleast get a 90%. You wait for 2 weeks until the exam marks come out and then you see you got a 70 some % or less. N THERE lies theCATCH Her INCOMPETENT T.A.S mark unfairly on purpose!\n",
            "Class was 100 % online. The course was pretty much self paced (only deadlines, no meetings). The course used Canvas and McGraw-Hill Connect/SmartBook. Reading was understandable and exams were similar to quizzes. There was a 6 page book report and and an extra credit opportunity. This class was perfect paced for me (single mom, full time job).\n",
            "She is a hard grader.  She likes to trick you in the exam. She likes to questions that are not worth to ask (eg. %, RDA).  She grades term paper really hard, I found a professor to correct the paper for me, but I got a C. She is not helpful to ESL students.  When she asks for volunteers, she always thinks students as FREE LABOR.\n",
            "This is the type of class that you will give  % for but still get a bad grade.  Professor Jackson is unhelpful and his dirty jokes get old after a while.\n",
            "Good for Hist of Western Music.  He enjoys the music and keeps the class engaged.  One problem: He's easily ruffled by the slackers that sadly comprise a significant % of the Berklee student body.  He's constantly calling them out in class instead of either ignoring their chatter or kicking them out of the room, which he really ought to do.\n",
            "she knows her stuff and expects you to be to learn it. i took AP english in high school so it wasn't that difficult for me. but someone without AP english under thier belt could have a harder time. just be ready to give it a %  ot get out.\n",
            "3 tests each 28% and 7 homeworks that are really long( takes 5 hours ) each. he just go through slides doesnot actually explain everything. i wouldnt recommend him to anyone, 30% of the class dropped and only 10% got an A. thats what he showed us in class. i needed 0.64 % to get the passing grade that i wanted but he refused and said sorry.\n",
            "He is a 60 year old black man from Louisiana. He is very professional and old-fashioned. He doesn't use blackboard and he doesn't use slides or online material. His lectures are full of interesting and useful knowledge and he can be funny at times. TESTS ARE  % TEXTBOOK READING. Only homework is textbook reading, but you better keep up with that.\n",
            "Very Hard Class. He can be very confusing and gets frustrated quickly. He does not like to go over things. We only had 4 tests including the final. 90 % of the class was failing.\n",
            "Terrific prof! He is by far one of my favorite profs one of the best I had during my time at SFA. He is incredibly knowledgeable about history. He stands up and lectures instead of just making a PowerPoint and have everyone copy bullet points down so be sure to write his main points down. Hes also very approachable. I would  % take him again.\n",
            "THIS GUY IS BOSS! Best Math teacher I've ever had. One of the few teachers that's just gushing with enthusiasm! I was literally depressed when I didn't get him for  . This was my first Calc class ever, and he made me fall in love! Tests were rough, but the extra credit from homework saved me with a 90.7 %. Although he would have prolly rounded me\n",
            "Tests can be tricky. Attendance is mandatory yet it doesn't count towards grade %. Participation is a must, he keeps track. He can be fast but once u learn the material u do better so pay attention! Tests always contain questions form previous test. Most importantly dont take bathroom break or let ur cell go off.. hell embarrass u pretty bad\n",
            "Absolutely loved working with this professor. There are several essays, but they are to be no longer that 1-2 pages. Several video assignments. There are quite a few tests, but all questions and answers can be found in the book and the provided materials. Offers PLENTY of extra credit. Passed with a  %.\n",
            "great teacher. middle-aged black lady with a good sense of humor! if you are level-minded she is very easy to get along with. just dont b a dumbass or she will criticize you. passed her class with an  % which was low compared to others. drops 1 test grade. final is only 25% of grade. at least 5 extra credit chances worth 5 points each.\n",
            "the questions on the exams are not straight forward. she sucks. you cant reason with her. it is her way or not at all. i got an 82.4% in the class which i got a c in the class because her grading scale was 90-100 a , 83-89 b, c 75-82, etc. this made no sense and will not help you out that extra fraction of a % at the end.\n",
            "I thought he was great if you are looking for somone that tries to meet your needs. He is fair and will give  %.  He tests on just what he lectures on. You have to take notes. He will put you to sleep. No example or story telling for this ole guy. Strickly by the book. I made a B though!!\n",
            "Good teacher just kind of surprising the way he grade. He add all the extra credit to the final grade. He seems to be very hard, but at the end he gives a lot more. I was calculating to get a 80% and he gave  %.\n",
            "Dr Reyes is a great teacher. She is someone who is not afraid to speak her mind. Do not use electronics in her class as she does not like it. If you want to do well, participate in her class because she grades 15 % of the class grade on participation. She is very understandable and will give you extension on your papers if needed.\n",
            "One of the best history teachers at GRCC. His lectures are very interesting and he gives extra credit for attendance (minus 4 points every class you miss). He has you write a lot of papers though. He grades his exams by a curve (highest student gets 95 % on the exam, everyone gets 5 points). He doesn't let class out early; lectures until the end.\n",
            "Great professor, i was able to pull an A in the class. Very helpful with anything you need. He is a very well rounded professor who knows what its like to be a student and he treats us like he would want to be treated. He is also there for you  % of the time. He is very accomdating to any ones needs\n",
            "Taught useless PHIL 100 material that added no value. Had no problems reminding the class of his political opinions - I don't necessarily disagree with him, but it got old quite fast. Ridiculous final, 30 minutes long, required NO thought - just remembering absolutely USELESS facts ie MC what was the % decline of factory workers in   Who CARES\n",
            "He is excellent teacher! He knows what he does for 100 %. Even though it was a composition class, we read a lot of novels and I loved the way how he analyzed them. He makes class really interesting. We had 4 papers and 2 exams. Basically you have about a month to write your paper. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I would definitely take another class with him. \n",
            "Doesn't teach. Rambles for 60 minutes  reads off test questions and answers. I have never felt more like a vegetable than I do in his class. I stopped going because it was so intensely boring. Just find a quizlet and study it for 30 minutes before the test to get a 95+%. He amazingly makes interesting content boring. Also highly favors athletes\n",
            "Belk is a super nice person and avid teacher. She strives to be  % and have her hands in many activities. I wish that she would accommodate the students a little more by regarding them as adults. Her organizational skills are awesome but they do sometimes hinder her from seeing the subjectivity of college life. A little too involved at times.\n",
            "i got a  % in her class. soo easy. you dont need to read the text, she gives you a study guide right before the test and just find the answer in the text. her tests are so easy\n",
            "French is not easy but the way she breaks the words down and provides so many notes<hand written via on the  board> you have what you need to study and learn. she's great at wat she does! she knows her S%&T!! Take her! you wont regreet it:)\n",
            "Tina is by far the best teacher I have ever had.  If you put in the effot she will do anything to help you.  She is incredibly passionate about everything she teaches and puts in  % to every class.  If you have the opportunity, take a class from Tina!\n",
            "Dr. Parsons is a great professor. Yes, she is HARD. She expects the most out of her students and no, she will not pass you if you do not put  % effort into the class. Her tests are hard, so it makes you want to come to class so you do not miss a thing. If you like a challenge, she is the best teacher.\n",
            "In love Ms. Badger, she is the best , as long as you show that you are trying and you come to class she will work with you  %%%%%....\n",
            "Nice guy but I've learned very little, and Im no expert. Have no clue what to take notes on and fall asleep in class due to endless 80's films. Seen the class drop from about 40 to if your lucky 20. If he had his s%#t together better, Im sure he'd be an awesome teacher.\n",
            "He's a really nice guy, always willing to help, his notes SUCK - they're terrible - read the text book.  On the bright side, he gives extra marks, ALL THE TIME, people get  % on quizzes all the time, AND he recycles his quizzes and midterms, so find anybody who had him for   and you're set.\n",
            "Disorganized and confusing! Go to class participate you will do fine. She allows late assignments due 2 her disorganization. All you have to do in the class is articles relating to each chapter and write a paragraph summary. Plus 3 exams she gives u the topics/questions. People usually get 80- % on the exams. plus group work thats not hard.\n",
            "He would tell us that he wouldn't be testing us on something, then it would be on the test,  tell us not to worry about sig figs or rounding errors on tests, then fail us on questions for errors that were wrong by . %.  I asked a question on REVIEW day, which he seemed rushed through, and he told me to look it up in the textbook.\n",
            "I remember leaving the classroom the last day, I told him I learned a lot of you He said, I learned a lot FROM you I never made that mistake again. Also, my grammar improved  %. He is strict, nobody enters the classroom after him but his advise is top quality. I had him back in   and decided to leave this review now in  . I remember him\n",
            "Good teacher in lecutre, horrible writer when it comes to exams. The 3rd exam was insanely difficult and the grades on this M.C. tests were very low. 4th test was very fair, but after averages near mid 50% for exam 3, it was too little too late. Be careful w/ exam 3, it took took many peoples overall grades 7-10 +%! Go to class pay attention!\n",
            "Ann is a fantastic professor. On beginning assignments, you might not start out with A's, but she is so helpful and you WILL see real improvement in your work. Good grades are possible. She knows the PR profession inside and out. Also, despite her cancer diagnosis, she remains dedicated to doing  % as a professor. She inspires me to do my best!\n",
            "This class requires  % dedication. Grade is based ENTIRELY on 10 question, multiple choice, tricky quizzes on every single chapter. You absolutely have to know the material backwards and forwards and do the homework (not graded or collected), or you will fail miserably. Wille doesn't have a 70% plus drop rate for nothing. Nice guy, poor teacher.\n",
            "I have never failed a class before. This is one of my few. It's not because I'm lazy and didnt read, its just that even when I read, his quizzes are full of tricks. You must really know know the material really good to not be fooled by it. Unless you have a good background in Acct, dont take this course unless you are willing to throw out  % effo\n",
            "guy thinks he's socrates but he's far from it.  Doesn't teach you a damn thing, just some bull*&^% about his own life, but nothing from the text.  he thinks he's outside the system but he's just storking his own ego. he's probably stupid and just covers up his lack of knowledge with small talk which is all he seems capable of doing.\n",
            "Professor Smith is Amazing! Video editing is not my forte, however, I learned so much in this class.  Do the work, show you're passionate. It was one of the most difficult classes I've taken, just give all of your assignments  %.  Turn all assignments in on time. Do what you're supposed to do you will pass!\n",
            "I had Prof Carmona Fall   Statistics: I got a  %. That's crazy extra credit. He makes it easy to pass, tests are pretty much a replica of the homework and he is always willing to stay after class and answer questions. You just have to show interest and be willing to learn. One of my favorite professors. Heavy accent but a great teacher.\n",
            "One has to be a fool to fail his course.  I took the hybrid version of this course and probably ended up getting around a  % in his class.  There are just some students that display absolutely no effort and will ultimately fail.  Even if one puts a little effort into every task, they will pass the course.  He is not one to fail people.\n",
            "Good luck.  The saying I'd better be lucky than good is applicable to this exam.  Don't overstudy for this exam.  He will ask off the wall SH$%^&*.\n",

            "Pire proff que j'ai eu a l'universitÃ©!!!! Si tu vas au cour ta un point de participation par cour (10 %) il explique vraiment mal. Melange les conceptsn, ne repond pas bien au question, parle toujours de son facebook pis d'Ã©cologie (voiture hybride)... Avec ce prof c'est comme si vous suivez un cour a distance!!!!!\n",
            "I though this class was great. The guy is bloody encyclopedia, and the material he teaches is interesting. I can't see how anyone can do poorly in this class. He complained that I wasn't doing enough of the extra credit even though what I did do made it so my lowest test score was  %.\n",
            "This is not a hard class at all, but all of the work is done online. You write summaries of the chapter, take practice and real quizzes, and then a small % of your grade comes from clicker participation in class. You have to teach yourself. He just covers the high points. kinda monotone. a numbers man. Gives long explanations for yes+ no answers\n",
            "Arnie Arluke is by far one of the all time greats when it comes to story telling and it's near impossible for you to fail his quizzes. If a certain % of the class gets a question wrong, he automatically gives everyone the points! He's a very understanding teacher and you're missing out if you don't take his Intro to Sociology class!\n",
            "This is directed to the gentleman who is constantly whining on this site about Ed's class. GET OFF YOUR ASS YOU LAZY #@%$! Maybe if you spent less time complaining at internet sites and more time doing your work, you would be getting better grades.\n",
            "doesn't teach well. just makes you read. weird mood swings. seems not to care if you pass as evidenced by her 30-50 % failure rates....... and she refuses to grade on a curve. I think she gets a sadistic kick out of trying to make the tests impossible. Suggests openly that people withdraw in order not to get an F on their transcript.\n",
            "RUNNINGBEAR IS PASSIONATE ABOUT TEACHING ENGLISH. SHE GIVES HER STUDENTS  %.SHE EVEN CRIES WHEN HER MOST STRUGGLING STUDENTS GET IT. IF ONLY SHE WOULD TEACH H.S ALOT OF KIDS WOULD GO TO GREAT UNIVERSITIES. SHE NEEDS TO TEACH AT HIGHSCHOOLS SO SAT SCORES CAN GO UPPPPPPPP!!!!\n",
            "When reviewing the lab diagrams; be sure to click 'other views' for viewing hidden diagrams. Review multiple choices that comes up for the 4 lab practical hw; be sure to take photos to review for the main exam. Be sure to do the hws to boost your grade. Got an average of 87 % for the 6 tests ; was enough to attain A grade; the homeworks up da grade\n",
            "Serious $^#^% alert! Blathers on and on about nothing, classes run long every time, tests are absurd, and he is well hated among students. Do not lets those plants below fool you they all sound like the same person... ask around and you will soon find, he is the most despised teacher at Chico State. VERY VERY boring classes. Chapman, go away!\n",
            "Boring as hell... hard to understand because of her accent. Tells you all the stuff she is going to ask on the exam if you show up to class.most of the time only about 10 % of the students actually came to class.you don't need to read the text, she does that for you  EVERY CLASS. Easy credit to those who show. Nice looking lady\n",
            "everything anyone every says about him is 99 % true, WSJ will take you down...\n",
            "The worst teacher I've ever come into contact with.  If accounting is not your major; take her if you want a  % for learning absolutely nothing.\n",
            "I will admit I have had accounting classes before, but this class is EASY. She gives out tons of extra credit, mainly quizzes that are just bonus. Totals your extra credit and adds half to your final grade. I have a  % as does half my class. TAKE HER!\n",
            "Prof. Noga was one of the hardest profs I've ever had at Bentley. The class was an unfathomable amount of work. The one nice thing is that there's so many graded assignments that nothing counts for a heavy %. Otherwise, she is not clear about what she wants in the projects and I didn't find her to be a good teacher at all. DO NOT TAKE.\n",
            "Do not take biology with this teacher. She is a new teacher so she hasn't been taught on how to teach her students well. I went to the tutor who explained all the notes easily. She scares you into taking BIO  . Her tests are nothing like her study guides. Beware. Our class average was a 55 %.\n",
            "Avoid this teacher.  Her expectations are completely unrealistic and you will pay, in frustration and lousy grades.  The requirements for her projects are very specific and impossible to follow. She is unflexible and unrealistic at the same time, a bad combo. I have completed 75+ units with a 4.0 until this class, and it's *#@%$%^  education class!\n",
            "Worst teacher.  You have to pay attention 100 % because he will ask things you never imagine on the test.  Also dosen't care if you pass at all.\n",
            "omg for all the ppl complainin on this board...grow up, not only did he go over his examples multiple times (the exact same ones so you understood it) the exact same type of question was on the tests there were no suprises, and he always added extra % to everyones marks!\n",
            "I think the MU should finally look at this site. Shes an absolute nut case. Drop her if you take her dony waste the time and money and let your GPA suffer. Honestly we should all think about suing MU for having to take her because i feel like an absolue @$% after taking this BS class. she doesnt have tenure so just fire her i dont see the problemMU\n",
            "two huge papers.  easy tests.  i got 100+% in class\n",
            "I never had a better math teacher, he will make sure you understand the subject test you on exactly what he teaches, unlike many other professors. I always thought i was bad at math and on order to get a decent grade i had to give  % effort, but after his class it all changed around for me.\n",
            "Great at getting people to join choir, but expects  % from you on top of all the work you already have with your other classes...\n",
            "No need to go to class. He just transfers notes to the board. Very helpful outside class and is crystal clear on content for midterms. Shows concern for your improvement. Midterms are impossible to finish but final is easy. Also gives the option to drop a midterm and add the % to final.\n",
            "bi-weekly quizes were impossible with over half the class failing each of them. However the labs were marked really easy to bring everyones mark up (was worth 30 %). The final was also brutally hard just like the quizes. Avoid at all costs\n",
            "Go to class or you are screwed.  If you were the best student in the world with the most participation and a  % in the class she will drop you a letter grade if you don't attend class.  Psycho about attendance, cares little for how well you do in class or what you put in, cares lots about making sure you are there to get picked on.\n",
            "If English is not your first language, you might wanna hesitate taking this class since it involves so much writing. But otherwise, she's an easy grader who offers a LUDICROUS amount of extra credit. (You could conceivably pull a  %.) No midterm or final exam. There's usually a few international students in class, which is kinda cool.\n",
            "Very interesting class, engaging prof. However the class size is really too big for a grad seminar. Next time that there are so many individuals in the class, reduce the % for participation, or have the presentations start earlier in the term (4 presentations leaves little time for others in the class to comment).\n",
            "He's a good guy but expects  %. Be prepared for homework galore.\n",
            "TERRIBLE--- not helpful in class at all. I stopped asking questions by week 3 because she was so B*&%y\n",
            "Mr. Briseno is a funny man you'll love him, I actually liked his lecture I think it was the only class I liked. There's 5 tests and he gives you a study guide for all of them a 90 % match with the actual test so memory is needed. For extra credit you have to attend several concerts which are fun. I highly recommend his class. Easy A if you study...\n",
            "Wow, this class was really easy. I don't know if I learned anything but I got an easy A. His tests are tricky, but it does not really matter since an 85% is an A in his class. I got like  % on the homework, there is so much potential for extra credit. Hard to understand his english.\n",
            "He's unclear sometimes when it comes to the assignments. gives out LOTS of handouts for homework. open book quizzes and test. one short interesting novel to read. no final if your average is more than a % determined at the end of class. nice guy.\n",
            "This is probably one of the best professors i have ever had. He is strict listen to  what he doesn't want you to do and dont.Anyways, he is extremely helpful and the way he explains things and relates it to everyday life makes it so much easier.He is Hilarious!Gives you lots of XC i actually got like  % or  % in his class A+++,AMAZING TEACHER!\n",
            "She is very easy. There are a lot of projects but they are fairly simple. One includes a physical fitness test. The tests are all mc and t/f. Sometimes her questions are specific as in % and amounts. She uses blackboard which was helpful for me since I barely even went to class. Recommend.\n",
            "Dr. Hou is a decent lecturer. His accent isn't too hard to understand. However, his handwriting is sloppy and it is hard to read it when you are sitting in the middle or further back of the lecture hall. He doesn't post lecture notes on blackboard. His tests are much harder than other profs. When I took it, the other prof had a 20 % higher test avg\n",
            "Best teacher ever! She has lots of little busy work projects but it's really easy. Gives lots of extra credit, I failed 2 tests and still got a B+ so if you put in the  % you will get a good grade. She will go out of her way to help you even of it doesn't directly deal with school.\n",
            "Class was significantly trickier than I thought. The curve is insane where a 50 is a C. His class is incredibly boring but he is a nice guy where if you asks questions during class, he will help you out pretty clearly. Overall, if you don't intend on putting in  % effort during class studying, expect a B because that's what most people get. \n",
            "Awesome. Easy to get a good grade. The tests are hard, so take good notes and read the text assignments. Homework is a must and attendance crucial. You only need 80% of the total points available in the class to receive an \"A\"   2nd chance to improve the grade during critique. Overall class performance determines % given for improvement of scores.\n",
            "10% assignment , 25% mid term , 25% final term , 40% project , 10 % discretion of Prof per class involvement.  Course content is weak and his teaching  even weaker.Frankly you dont learn much out of his lectures. I found the text book more helpful. Exams are with average difficulty.DO HIS ASSIGNMENTS you will score well in exams.Avoid the course\n",

            "Absolutely nonexistant grading expectations. Never teaches you to write and then arbitrarily lowers paper grades. Overly cynical. Terrible movie choices. Grading structure is ridiculous. 100 points in the entire course 1 pt = 1 %.\n",
            "I failed chem in high school but got a  % in this class. Don't be afraid to ask him questions during and after class, he's very willing to help out if you're having trouble. He makes chemistry fun and goes the extra mile for his students. Wish he taught the higher level chem classes too!!\n",
            "I am not going to go into his horrible attitude or incomprehensible teaching. At one point I scored a D on one of his tests and it was a  % with the curve.

Group project is 40 %, case tools quiz is part of the 35% participation(take home exam)and the final(3 questions for a case). google the cases and you will find an analysis from other students from different colleges Easy breezy\n",
            "super easy! i showed up maybe 50 % of the time and got a B this guy is too easy. if you don't like getting out early don't take him. oh yeah and he takes you all over the campus. good for a new student but if you already know the campus or how to do things for your self its super boring. EASY EASY A\n",

I met with Dr. Liechty several times and saw the Science tutor multiple times. I did a lot of extra work for extra credit and it paid off. I got an A in the class and a  % on my paper but I couldn't have done it without her!\n",

Very fair grade % distribution amongst participation, tests, etc. If you put forth a decent effort, you WILL get an A. He makes the material fun, and the class is great. Also great for getting an A+ for the 4.3 GPA booster!\n",

I missed probably 8 classes, read 1/7 books, and almost failed a quiz and got killed on the papers, but still ended up with a 99 in the class because of tons of extra credit due to the flawed participation grade.

He does tend to repeat his stories (he's 60-something) but he will try his best to make sure you understand a concept. If you don't get it it may be that you can't get it. Witty, funny, helpful and gives plenty of extra credit to boost your grade (I earned  %).\n",

Often forgets what she is talking about, and when she thinks she has remembered its confusing for the class to follow her train of thought. She is a woman minority so that is often what she talks about constantly, without having a non biasis opinion. The work is easy if you do the reading, and you can tolerate wasting an hour of your life three times a week. In my opinion get the F*$% out!\n",

            "to be honest, her homework and quizzes are easy, but the exams are  % harder.  for the general assignments, she grades not according to your ability, but minor things like did you put your partners' names, dates, activity number, etc. If you're looking for a teacher who teaches you things, just don't choose her when you still have choices.\n",
            "horrible professor! he talks down to you.He tries to tell you he's done everythin he could to help you and its not his fault he lacked in teaching any sort of valuable information to you but its YOUR fault you failed. Acts like he is the $&!%. Grading expectations are ridiculous and he always seems to have his favorites that somehow manage to slip \n",
            "WOW!!! This teacher is unbelivable. All the negative feedbacks are  % true.  She forces you to ask ques. when you don't even know what the heck your learning. Oh and come late to class!! Watch out-you have to bring snacks for the whole class.I don't work my a-- off to feed others!!\n",
            "Easiest Space Mech teacher out there.  Several of us got over  % on the midterm, final wasn't that bad either. Downside: teaches right out of the book (Curtis's book). Not fun reading that.\n",
            "You won't feel sleepy on his class, although he is monotone. Cos He has a lot of jokes. His test very hard, especially on the final! The class ave. only 5x% If you did all the hw on time and all the practice ques, and good logic, you will be ok! :)\n",
            "Made me almost drop the first day making the class sound like hellllla work. It's nothing crazy once you settle in honestly. I think most people got at least a B and maybe half get A? A good % of grade comes from just completing journals and stuff. Definitely makes you think and keeps his bias to little/none. Although he points out his views :) \n",
            "Lots of people complaining about this teacher. Reality is, this teacher is an excellent teacher. She gives you  % of what you need to succeed in the course. All she requires is that you put the time into doing the work. All you have to do is apply yourself. It's not hard, she makes it very easy to understand, quick responses to email!\n",
            "Dr Adas is an amazing prof and  % take one of his classes again. he is straight up with what he wants you to know for exams, so going to class is very beneficial! if you pay attention and take notes its for sure an easy A. He is also very encouraging and such a beautiful person! if you get the chance take his class!\n",
            "she can't teach! this is a med dosage class and they should've had a nurse teach this class since they have more experience calculating dosages. she messed up on my grade. I had a  % from all the extra credit but she said i received a B in the class. What the hell is that she takes really long to answer your emails. worse teacher ever.\n",
            "Avoid him. His study guide is only one part of the test. More then 50 % of  the test came from out side.\n",
            "I highly recommend the 8-week online course for Barrington. This class is pretty straight up: read the chapters, take notes, and take the quizzes and tests. Make sure you know the terms and important %'s (for example, the % of obese Americans). Readingnote taking + quizzes, expect about 1-2 hours of work per week. She's also a very very nice lady.\n",
            "Although this course is a lot of work, it is  % worth taking. Dr. Adams is an amazing professor who loves teaching her knowledge. I did a lot of personal growth through this class. There are no tests, just a few essays and quizzes. 10/10 recommend!!! Everything is perfectly maple out in the sylly. I saved all my work until last minute  got A's\n",
            "Dr. Kinch gets a lot of negative comments, but I absolutely loved taking her. My writing improved  % because of her English   class. Its been exactly one year since I've had her, but without her influence, I would be lost. Since I am a history major, writing matters for me, and this woman saved me. \n",
            "Kinch was a heartless %*$#@, she did not care about a single person in her class. She would give two days to read stories and fails to realize that event hough you could do it. You do have other classes and Literature is not your major. She is very passionate about what she does but, also very unrealistic.\n",
            "lay off this teachers back nerds! SJSU is full of vegan organic people. lol. This teacher is cool, I like his I dont give a F%*k personality. Funny and blunt. He presents this class like a history class. Some classes dont have a million assignments. Deal with it! Your in College.\n",
            "Class was good, but the professor seems to want to give out a certain % of A, B, and C's. He was a bit unreasonable about grades and couldn't validate how he came up with the scale. Fun class, but considering it was so easy, a bummer when he gives out A- and B+ just for the heck of it...\n",
            "He is really strict for attendance- he shuts the door of u go even 3 min. late. He is the hardest grader on the paper( 98 % of the class gets a C) and on exams and his exams aren't easy because u have to remember every detail from the notes which is hard. However if u do everything and kinda of beg for a good grade he might give u a C.don't take hi\n",
            "Seemed culturally knowledgeable at first, later it really _seemed_ like her only interest was preventing overprivileged white people from passing. Asked specific details about population % during specific time periods; ignore her lectures and surf the web.

            "I wouldn't take another class with her. period. In fact, I'm not sure if I will ever regain my interest in soci.  Though she seemed to know her stuff, 80 % of the time she seemed miserable (like teaching was an absolute labour) and was rude to the students. not pleasant.\n",

Very nice person. Neg. Comments= people who are mad that they actually HAVE to learn the art of public speaking.THX\n",
            "I should say that she is not a savvy professor; in more than one occasion, I have heard her apologizing, saying that Biological psychology in not her area. If what she says is true then why she accepts to teach a course whose content she does not handle!!!!!!!@#%$@& Her performance is very disappointing.\n",
            "I definitely recommend her. She is a very sweet lady who wants you to succeed. But make no mistake about it.....this is a very hard class! Probably the hardest class imaginable! Lectures last the entire 3 hours! It aint no joke. But if you put   % and never, ever give up....you just may come out with a B or a C. Or an A if you are really good. :)\n",
            "I regret taking his class. He does not teach, it was a waste of time. It's easy but if you plan on becoming a p.o. u don't want to take this class, because u don't get an understanding out of it. Grading is not so fair, I don't think he calculates the %, I dony know! Would not take him again.\n",
            "This class was easy. I ended up with  %. Scream in every paper that global warming is destroying the earth and you end up with an A. There are also two extra credit assignments, so i think that unless you don't do your work it is impossible to get less than a A. Quizes you can take and just look up the answers while you test.\n",
            "Loved him, first test a lil hard but once you get to see how he puts the questions together you'll do fine. Ended up with 100+% since there was some extra credit on the tests.... funny and really nice... dunno wuts up with the previous comment.... if you read the book and study the notes u'll be just fine :-D\n",
            "There really aren't any easy blow off science credits. This class is 2/3 poltics and 1/3 actual science and seismology. Politics part is easier, seismo is harder, but thats the point of the class-seismology. 3 tests and a final. 4 homeworks. Homeworks are worth 5 % each and actually can be difficult. Format for class is constantly changing, though.\n",

            "Easiest class ever. Grade is based on 10 pop quizes, in which you get credit for attending, and two take home exams. He sometimes makes comments that he later has to apologize for. He also thinks that he is right  % of the time. But if you go to class its an easy a. take this class if you need to boost your gpa\n",
            "not that hard, very clear on what he wants done. test are impossable, but you get extra credit viedos for every test so you can fail all the test and get a b in the class. just follow directions to the T and you will do fine. He's kind of an A$%hole so watch out though.\n",
            "He is the worst, worst proff ever. After a 40 % average on the midterm, he comes to class saying this is a wake up call for me except now he does less. Doesn't even bother posting assignments up. Doesn't come to mandatory lectures and instead cuts the material in half. We are sure gonna have fun in the other ece courses without knowing hashtables\n",
            "He told us some material wasn't covered on our midterm. Then he gave a 20 % mark question on that. Long midterm with questions on projects we haven't done yet. He is very rude. He said whoever failed that midterm belongs in the gutter. He can't teach jack. When this guy talks, time stops. So slow and monotonic. Made my favorite course a disaster.\n",
            "WORST PROF EVER! The only way to get an A is if you're an actual genius when it comes to Math. Otherwise you are gonna be F*&^%ed over. Thick ass accent and reads directly out of the book. Even if you teach yourself, good luck, he tries to take points off where ever he can, even if you forget an equal sign. NEVER EVER TAKE HIM!HE SHOULD BE FIRED!\n",

He also gives practice exams and they are very similar to the real exam. Downside: he's VERY confusing if you don't read the book.\n",
            "Do not take this professor she is very judgmental and not open minded. Disorganized, very monotone and thinks she is right about everything but just  sounds arrogant. 98 % of my class feels the same way. Worst professor I have had. You will do fine in the class if you study all your notes since she never gives study guides.\n",
            "I dropped this class. I know i didnt put my  % into it but i have 3 classes and work 35 hours. Not a class for someone who does not have time. Homework due every week, an in class quiz as well.\n",
            "Mr. Melson is the math proff everyone should take, he is great, very engaging in his class, and does the work so you know the process. He cares about every students performance and gives 100 % literally. its just up to you if you want an A or not. He is always at the math lab and replies emails quick. I give him 5 stars!!!!\n",
            "Typical Southeast pussbrats complaining about everything.  Anyone who complains about this class, sadly will not even complete a 2 year school.  If you think this class is hard drop out of college now.  If you come, you will pass.  She gives as much as  % on assignments.  I think I had like   out of   points at the end of the semester\n",
            "I am a mngmt student and this class is The Biggest mess I have ever seen... No course materials, U go to class without any clue of whats going on, no one gets what he's saying, He misunderstands his own quiz questions and changes corrections... Basically if u want to do well U have to take notes  % of the time.. if u loose pace u mess ur grade\n",
            "What should be more focused on writing, he decided that we should read atleast  % more than we wrote. I cant understand him, and ended up getting a very unfair grade.  If you take his class, make sure to become his pet, or you will suffer the lower grade. Hes the Chisunkanator.\n",
            "Great prof and great lecturer. The other people who are concerned about the pace probably didn't read his power points or the textbook at all beforehand. If you come having done that you'll be fine. Very relatable and lectures keep you engaged. Would  % take a class if he was teaching it again.\n",
            "Best professor ever. He gives importance to what really has it. Assignments are submitted via email, they are very easy and you learn about today's economy. I wish I could take all of my classes with him.  % recommended if you want to skip some stress next semester.\n",

            "G-Wiz is charismatic and a great teacher. My complaint, however, is that it is so easy to get an A in the class (I ended up with a  %), that there isn't great motivation to learn the material and students are shocked and unprepared when they enter organic chemistry which is a better representation of the difficulty of college science courses.\n",
            "Dr. Jones is professional, intelligent, stands by her syllabus  %.  Everything on the tests she has said or read aloud during class so pay attention, she won't review it a second time (unless you have a specific problem that isn't a HW problem she has reviewed).  Her emphasis is on the big picture, so don't count on memorization for this course\n",

DO NOT TAKE HIM, even if it's the only time available!!!\n",
            "Very smart woman. Learned more in this class than any other class. She expects  % out of her students, so slackers beware. She sticks to her policies, and is 100% fair. She wants you to earn your grade, and will not give you the grade in the end if you haven't earned it. YOU WILL LEARN COOL STUFF!\n",
            "This course has the toughest exams in case one has no access to previous yr's question papers. People having the previous papers have an unfair advantage over others. Projects are easy which constitutes 30 % of the grade. My suggestion to those planning to take this course is solve the past papers for the exams. \n",
            "Frank... theres not much to say about this prof but basically after midterms are handed back, only 10% of the class shows up and I was in that %. All he really does is read off slides the whole class and dismisses us once he finishes the last slide. I managed to get an A in the course because I had taken economics in hs. But if I hadn't.....\n",

SHE TALKS A LOT AND HAS TONS OF ENERGY, AND SHE GIVES  % DURING CLASS, EVEN WHEN SHE IS NOT FEELING WELL, SO SHE EXPECTS THE SAME FROM STUDENTS, PARTICIPATION IS MANDATORY. IS A FUN CLASS, BUT DON'T BE LATE OR MISS WITHOUT LETING HER KNOW. PARTICIPATION = A+, WE WROTE OUR OWN TESTS, AND GRADED OURSELVES.\n",
            "If your late to class and don't study you will not get an A. She does want you to suceed but her exams are hard. Exams and Practicals are mostly memorization. Even though i had 94- % on the exams she dropped my grade to 86% because i would come late and miss the 3 point clicker quizes. If your grade is in the 80% final will only bring you up 2%.\n",
            "A real gem of a teacher who gives  % into teaching English. One of the best professors I've had at El Camno College. Really made me participate and enjoy going to class in a way almost none of my other profs did. 10/10\n",
            "I am a science major, so I was bored out of my mind in this class.  Lectures are just rehashing the prior night's reading.  No tests, just one easy question per class for homework and 4 essays which can be corrected and resubmitted for a higher grade.  I ended with a  % in this class. It was a joke.\n",

            "Cantella is the man. People who fail this man's classes are, in my mind, utterly retarded. He lays out exactly what you need to do and goes over everything in plenty of detail.

            "IF you have a hard time in math don't take this professor. He is friendly and will keep you encourage. I felt like he thought everyone understood his teaching. He doesn't give any extra credit at all. His test is 65 % of your final grade.\n",
            "Sandy's a weird one. Her class was a super easy A. I think I got a  % in that class and that's with missing a couple classes. Trust me, I'm no over-achiever. There's plenty of EC and the final is easy. She makes everyone dance with each other. I for don't know, if you're looking a fun dance class, take swing. I still bust out some moves now.\n",
            "She is an amazing professor who brings a diverse background of knowledge with her into the classroom.

She is also amazing at helping connect students with scholarship, conference and job opportunities.\n",
            "Ryzhkov is a really cool guy. For every question on a test he will have 2 bonus questions.  This means it is possible to get a  % on a test. However the questions are pretty hard so the grades very rarely go over 100%.  He also counts everything over an 85% as an A.  He can be confusing but is willing to meet with you after class if you need help\n",
            "At first, you might be intimidated by his teaching style. In the end, Kretlow is a pretty cool guy. Show up to class ON TIME(he memorizes who shows up), pay attention in class, and put a  % for every assignment. This class is relatively easy, just watch out for stupid mistakes and put a serious effort into evrything.\n",

I am an English major and want to improve my writing, yet this instructor gave all of my papers 100 % when I know they weren't that impressive.

Absolutely wonderful!\n",
            "This is one the the BEST and most AMAZING teachers I've ever had. He always gives  % at everything he does, and he's always there to help.. you just have to make the effort to meet him halfway. All that he asks from students is that they give it their all.

            "This class is very boring and nonchalant. If you make all A's on the quizzes and on the reaction papers you should do okay, because the test are hard as s$%t. None of his lecture notes are on the test.\n",
            "The class is tough, and he is very sarcastic. I do not feel that even if I was to give  % and go to the writing lab I could write to his standards. I will say this be warned if you want a class were you have to find someone who is an English major write all your papers to pass then go for it. If not withdraw and find another teacher.\n",

            "Kapica is reasonable, fair, straight-forward. Math: solve for x, unit conversions % calc. Intro Chem tests/quizzes are straight from course hand-out lecture. No surprises. STUDY THAT HAND-OUT! Do all the homework, take notes, ask questions, get help if you need it. You will be fine!! Sort of like learning chem from your mom.\n",
            "Since the first day of class I knew it would be fun. The papers are really easy and she is really helpful. She has a real interest in the subject of english and she likes when you ask many questions and act like your into the course. I recommend her  % Take her before the class closes!\n",
            "Dr. Babu is just not good at teaching the material. However, I would  % recommend taking his class over other professors. He curves the class way more so you're almost guaranteed a decent grade. There's a book I bought that teaches the material better than any of the professors and makes the class SOOO much easier (OChem as a second language).\n",
            "I took Anatomy at IVC and it almost killed me to get a \"C\". Professor G is the easiest and nicest Anatomy teacher...I got  % and 90% of class got A's. She basically tells you what is on exams which is in her review...very easy teacher and very clear...super nice..must take her!\n",

            "She has the most F**% up syllabus that I have ever seen. You have to jump all over the place to find out exactly how she wants the work submitted. The bulletin board is full of question trying to find out what the hell is going on. She wants you to post bulletin postings by Wednesday, but in the syllabus it says recommends by the early week.\n",
            "Hans is a great guy, talks slow but is very knowledgeable. Probably the easiest class I have taken at UNI, I think I got  % on every quiz which made up for the fact that I didn't study for the tests,still got a B+\n",
            "He just lectures the whole time during class and they are mostly boring.  TA grades all your work. Class is graded on a curve now so only a certain % can get an A, B, C, etc. Totally unnecessary for a GE class, and I'd avoid taking it for this reason. For the quality of work I gave this class, getting a B is a joke. Keep the curves at Marshall.\n",
            "EXTREMELY easy class if you simply do the work. I only needed a 24 on the final to get a B, and a 64 to get an A. he scales so much. Just do the homework and take notes during lecture modules, easiest A ever. Only need 80% on both lecture modules and homework assignments to get full credit, and the class is based off  % so 90- % is an A!\n",
            "STUDY!!!! STUDY!!!! STUDY!!!!! She expects you to know EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! Mrs. Maleki is GREAT!!!! I would 100 % take her over again if she taught another class.

            "Replies to emails thoroughlypromptly. Often available in office. Knows subject like back of his hand: both pro con for beginners. Coddled poor performers by cutting chapters, dropping tests making an easy final worth an inordinate % of overall grade. Coolest concepts untested. Unusually high standards for UH. Great textbook. Funny, dry humor.\n",
            "He is good, but he is HARD. Very slim chance you'll make an A or even a B+ because he expects near perfection on every paper, but I gurantee you will become a better writer with his class.

            "i think professor leonard was awesome... he really did make you learn, and he was a very hard grader, but overall i really enjoyed his class and you get extra credit for perfect attendance, but i still didnt manage to get an A, even though i am a good writer... and if he is serious about making a Harry Potter class, i will get  %!!!\n",

            "She was known as the workout nazi by my class. After a week you will definitely be referring to her as my pain in the a%&   professor. The class is always taught by her and a grad student ALWAYS pick the grad student, they are usually pretty chill\n",
            "Dr. Markus is by far the best college professor I have ever had/ will have. She loves what she teaches and everything's very clear. She cares for the students. The work is super easy.  Everyone should get an A in this class. I got  % and  % on both tests. She makes class fun and interesting and she's very compassionate if you have a problem.\n",

            "She is a tough grader pushes her students to do well. She never gives a 100% on any of the graded discussion, despite me having literal drawn out solutions scanned into the computer (online class).

            "HORRIBLE. Has this grading system where there's a total of 100 points for the whole semester and every single point you earn throughout the semester counts towards your final % grade.to make it even more impossible to get an A/A-,he has this really strict grading system.out of 10 points for an assignment,you can only score even numbers.STEER CLEAR!\n",
            "Uhm...yeah.  Tomita-sensei is very much a Japanese professor, which means that if you are willing to give  % to EVERYTHING you do for him, he'll love you.  If you happen to have a life, or any other interests besides Japanese, good luck (just check out how many people stick with Japanese through Kenyon...that should be a good hint).\n",
            "I really liked Prof. Pires.  She does give a lot of homework, but it's just stuff you go over in class. After a while we didn't have to do the cahier or the listening exercises, which I thought saved a lot of time.  She's a nice person who cares about her students.  As someone mentioned, participation is 50 % of the grade, so you do have to go.\n",
            "he is a great intro teacher. this is the class he fits most accordingly. his tests are easy if you study the notes he sends in email each week and he has a nerdy sense of humor that is funny as #%$@. all in all a great teacher. really enjoys his job.\n",
            "HORRIBLE !                  Makes the course so much harder than it is. His tests are brutal, and nothing like the book or what he does inclass. He is very ignorant when you go to see him. He had a 40 % class average on our second test and blamed it on the class being lazy.  Avoid him at all costs! .. PS: Dont use your lap top in his class!\n",
            "HILARIOUS prof! Really clear and helpful.. even stated himself that if you miss a test will give you a second chance even without a doctors note as long as if he feels your not full of *@%# ... also barely studied for the midterm and got a decent mark.. the course structure is a big pain however with many assessments.. overall definitely recommende\n",
            "Took this class over the internet, grades hard, I made a killer webpage (used lots of creativity like she said) and did not get an A.   She took 9 points off a paper for incorrect APA citation.  I was less that a % away from a B.  Did she give me a B\n",
            "Miss Odonnel' is by far the best teacher i have had at this school. She cares about her students, gives herself  %. Anatomy is a hard class but she puts energy into her lectures, and more importantly puts the information into words you can understand. SHE IS FAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "cool class, cool prof (although he likes primus way too much), work load reasonable. the only thing that sucks is his marking system- its 10 % lower than it should be- the fail mark is 60%. I got 85%, and that was still only a B.\n",

            "HE'S BORING AS SH*%, ppl drop out cuz he's that boring. All the quizzes are hard. Uses book, book website, and his own notes to teach. He goes over 1 chapter a week (sometimes 2 or 3)(sometimes more)(each chapter is bout 20 pgs. long). Though his midterm is easy (he posts 60 Q's online and picks 30). STILL, HE IS NOT RECOMMENDED.\n",

            "Loved the classes, learned so much. Hard subject, but he makes it easy to understand. Gives extra credit. Offers help as long as you do the work. If you give  % , you can get over 100% in the class! ?'s on quizzes may be on midterms, and those ?'s on final, so study them! ?'s come right out of the material. He usually emails back within 48 hours.\n",
            "The tests in his class are easy. The lectures are very informative, be prepared to take tons of notes. The discussion class is 20 % of the grade, which sucks, because there are always kids there who love the sound of their own voice.\n",
            "She is the WORST teacher I have ever taken. She grades waaaaay too hard. You will fail a paper, which are 70 % of your grade just due to grammer. I would be very happy if she was fired.\n",
            "Ms Troy is the sh*%! She is like the best math teacher.  She teaches at a medium pace so everyone understands.  She also loves for students to come talk during office hours to get clarification on hw and tests.  She really cares for her students.\n",
            "Arianne is a nice person, but the class is way more work than it needs to be. For a 100 level class, they teach it like a   level major specific class. As someone who was already interested and well versed in feminism, I thought I would enjoy the class, but the papers are long and quizzes (although they are a large % of the grade) don't exist.\n",
            "Wastes 20min each class begging students to speak. Makes you feel like an incompetent idiot when you ask him any questions, so unapproachable. Wants YOU to teach HIM ??? Final exam 100 MC, worth 25% covering things he NEVER discussed. Doesn't use Sakai and grades on ABC scale not in % so you don't know your grade all semester. Take someone else!!!!\n",
            "Good teacher, very helpful at office hours, very clear.  This was his first time teaching Calc C this semester ( ) and he assigned A LOT of homework and it was VERY hard and it was graded VERY badly (by a TA), that combined with the fact that it was worth 90% of the final ( % of a test) made it barely bearable.  Other than the h/w he's great.\n",
            "Microbiology is hard, yes she is a good teacher, late too but everyone does that.. this class is deff not an easy A, unless you understand the microorganisms, very hard, she does her best to explain it, the whole class test average was 78 % thats bad, its very hard, no lie.. good teacher tho and understanding to help you out..\n",
            "Dr. Loh expects a lot from her students but she gives  %.  If you do poorly in her class it's becuase you didn't do your end of the work, she presents you with EVERYTHING you need to know, and then you have to work your tail off.  Overall GREAT teacher with amazing energy and enthusiasm for the subject and her students.\n",
            "This lady is my absolute favorite prof. by far. She makes everything chrystal clear in her notes. We only use an online book, and she tells you EXACTLY what to study, so you only need to look at that and your notes from class.  I have  % in the class from extra credit.  Absolutely AMAZING teacher! Such a fun class and lady. Learn so much!!!\n",

            "Midterm, Final, 15 page paper. Both tests are about 100+ Qs and he gives 60-70 minutes to finish. Open book/post-it notes but gotta study before hand because the time limit. Paper is honestly extremely easy if you read his rubric and ask Q. I got  % on the paper alone, its only hard if you procrastinate and dont read directions. Few classes req.\n",

            "he is a cool teacher!!!! don't really need the book just notes from blackboard.... highly recommend going to the study sessions because they are very helpful and the t.a.'s go over the whole study guide.... if u study somewhat hard for the tests you'll pass.... he curves a lot.... i think the highest % on each test was like a 66%.\n",
            "Took it online. 5 online tests 65 mins to complete 70-75 questions and they are not easy. (mostly small facts, %'s, and based off of the pictures in the text) If you memorize the entire textbook the final exam is extremely easy. There was also a video project that wasnt too bad. If you work your butt off you can achieve an A, but its not easy.\n",
            "when test time comes... study the information on the website do the practice quizzes religiously until you get a B% or better. i took maybe a page worth of useful notes the entire semester. EVERYTHING you need to know is in the quizzes or on the website. sure there are better profs and yeah she's tough... but certainly not impossible.\n",
            "Oh, my God, I really enjoyed a lot having to work with Janis Perez, she is one of the best English professors in MDC.  Despite her age, she seems to be only 30 years old: she puts all her best in her classes.  % recommended if you want to learn English\n",
            "Good Prof...learn lots during lectures....Come exam time you realize that you know nothing..oh wait you really do know nothing that is on the exam b/c the exam is on stuff that we HAVEN'T *#@%ING COVERED YET...mid-term class avg. 27% good work class!\n",
            "Hi ! honestly i dont know why people complain about her , she can be a little unclear with her english , i can agree with that , but once you put effort in the class , participate she will help you , she is so nice , but if you do not come to class , skip ,you are being lazy 100 %  you will get behind and probably fail DONT HATE APPRECIATE :)\n",
            "She is a wonderful IS   professor! You just need to pass the 3 tests to pass the class, all of the prep she gives you to help with the tests is really helpful and worth extra credit at the end of the class. You need to do the projects and the connect activities to help learn the material but other than that she is just wonderful!  % recommend!\n",
            "Conway-sensei is one of the nicest teachers here. The class isn't difficult - do the all the homework, participate in class and you'll do well. She's very knowledgeable and helpful. Quizzes and exams are easy if you study and she allows you to retake a test for a small %penalty of the new grade. I took all four of her classes and passed easily.\n",

            "Programs are pretty basic the first half of the semester. Lectures are straight from the book with walk through of examples. No exams just quizzes from each chapter that have true/false, multiple choice and one short answer. Gives extra credit. The final is writing a program on the computer with no help from other students but open note, open book and you can use past labs. I didn't finish the final but got over 100% in class. One student got  %.\n",
            "I had almost forgotten about her! I knew she taught SOC but not psychology-that explains a few things. I didn't have her as a professor, she was actually my EOP advisor my first semester. Quite a classy lady. Saved my a$% when Nuhlicek wanted to toss me for attendance early on. A debt of gratitude!\n",
            "She was literally the worst professor I've ever had. She changed how we were supposed to take an exam 2 hours before class. When reviewing tests she argued semantics and refused to remove questions that were missed because of the way she wrote them even when the class average was 68 % in a class full of A/B students.\n",
            "Great teacher!  Fun in class, lots of participation.  Hard marker, but gives a  % to help you get that A, you just have to be willing to work hard. Very clear on what the meanings of the stories you read in class are, but always open to new interpretations. Oh, and spell her name right !\n",
            "she talks in spanish the whole time and if you dont know spanish your gonna be lost and have to just read the book and try to get help from someone else. she doesnt speak english well so when she does speak your still lost. i did horrible on all my tests and quizes, b ut i got an 85.5 % by just doing all the homework and partisipating. be preparedc\n",
            "He is good, very soft spoken, however he can get tight on you. His test are easy, although tricky, make sure your read carefully, and make notes to yourself on his passages. I kinda wish I had taken his lecture. Take him cause MCallister will bust your *%! wide open!\n",

            "Milani was a riot! He kept me laughing the entire semester, but you could tell he had given up on actually holding people to any standards. I probably had a  % average with the rediculous curve he had to give so the lazy people wouldn't complain.\n",
            "He is very nice and excited about teaching. If you go to class and keep up with the material you will be fine for tests. Grading was almost a joke: midterms were out of a possible  % and the final,  %. One test was bad so he gave a take home 30% bonus for the test. If you can, take it honors: project is an additional 10% bonus on final grade!!!\n",

            "Take her! She is the easiest teacher I have ever had in this subject. She is lenient, allows late work, grades easy, and curves the exams. I recommend her  %! I don't have my grade yet, but I can't imagine it's under an A.\n",
            "He doesn't care about his student don't believe  him. Midterm 35% final 45% and 2 assignments 20%. Even if you recieve 90 on both he takes % so you will probably end up with 71 and depending how you did the assignments that will be your grade. he WILL NOT even budge to add a point to pass you. He will force you to retake the class.\n",
            "Very fun and easy class. Non-Rec majors seemed a bit uncomfortable, you just have to get in touch with your inner-child and have a good time. I have a  % before the final, so I only need 50% on it to still get an A, yes it is that easy.\n",
            "he is hot without the hat on. billy boy, you are useless. cook it raw with the camosun boy. and yo, word is, mandalines are played by puzzy cats. fiend. whatever you have learned before is complete crap... yo homes, that $#%@ is wack. dont take this, this, BAFOON if you wanna pass anglias. PEACE!\n",
            "She is horrible! She foucs on doing calculations BUT almost never show how its done.

STAY AWAY FROM HER\n",

            "A simply atrocious professor. Does not communicate to his teachers or TAs what is on his tests. The class averages for his midterms was in the mid-30 %s. Also, his lectures have no guidelines whatsoever. Is at UCSC primarily for research (I've been told), not teaching. Unfortunately, as students, we get the short end of the stick with him.\n",
            "Brilliant, brilliant man. Engaging lectures, not necessary to do the reading but attendance and participation are a large % of your final grade so you'll want to have it done at least once a week to contribute. Easy grader. Take him before you graduate! He is a leader in the field!\n",
            "This was a decent class, not a lot of work throughout the semester b/c there is only 1 exam which is culminiative (based on entire textbook=4-% class avg 65%) Many marks can be earned through just writing blogs (up to 13%) and there are 5 quizzes (worth 25%) that are fair too. 1 assignment which was not difficult either. Def recommend this class!\n",
            "i just finished taking this course with sandford ,  i pass my math 08 exam with 87 % i didnt think i would ever get that grade ever again in a math class since high school . he teaches math in a way that you remember and LEARN. great professor , great personality but be ready to learn , pay attention and you'll pass .  best professor ever\n",

            "Scathingly rude, abrasive, confrontational, short, snippet and down-right nasty. Despite the fact that I got an A, her course is pointless, and she is not a pleasure to deal with.

            "Great teacher! Would take him again.  Class projects were really fun! You learn alot of material doing them. If you study for the midterm then it'll be a breeze!

            "Great Teacher. She's an easy grader. On my final i got a 99 and to get an A in the class i needed an 100% and she gave me the extra points. I like how in the beginning of the course, our class got to decide the % for quizzes, test, participation, and homework. I also love the idea that Out of the 6 questions on the test u get to choose 5. \n",

He brought in cheesecake and brownies for us during our final!\n",

            "Def one of those teachers to stay away from.  She gives a ZERO% on any paper you write if it has any plagerism, so don't on planning to do that on papers.

I swear to god, they are the hardest son of b@$% But he makes up for it with his curve. Overall, probably the most credible teacher you will find. You can get the grade you want as long as you do what he wants\n",
            "she is awesome... She explains everything in a way that is easy ot understand. She does go a bit fast but if you keep up with the reading you will enjoy this class.

This is a senior level class so I put in  % and resulted in a very high A.Students who are complaining about how he was hard should grow up. This isn't kindergarten where everything is spoon fed. At university you will need to put in extra effort...if dont want to then quit n work at McD.\n",
            "Honestly I think he would be a decent teacher if he would spend more time with students in lab and if he tested differently. So I have to say that he is not a good teacher because his testing is just way too hard. He tests on very minute details of material instead of testing on stuff you should know. Class avg. on 1st lect. test was around 55 %.\n",
            "Great Prof!!! I read the 1st comment and it was absolute garbage - ne's upset about the C that he received in class and tried to get us allto write a bad review (we didn't).

            "Wonderful teacher.  Lecture covers 90+% of exams - listen and take good notes!  Makes class fun and interesting.  Group project wasnt so much fun, but its part of learning to COMMUNICATE.  Seems pretty laid back.  I enjoyed the class and had no interest in the class before starting, ended with a 4.0.  I'd recommend him to anyone!\n",

Grades unfair and is not that helpful. 10 pg. reasearch paper, 4-5 essays, and a load of  $#%# in her condesending attitude. DO NOT TAKE HER, NOT WORTH IT.\n",
            "Helpful at times. Often takes a bit to get back to you.  Assignments are straight forward, yet I go 90 % of on all of the Discussions, which I did not understand. It gave me the impression she may not have really read them. Tried to ask why, got no answer. Had two papers which I got 95 % on directions a bit sketchy, but she tried to clarify them.\n",

            "I really enjoyed this class. No homework, tests only. Offers extra credit so make sure you come to class so you are able to get all the extra credit she offers. Make flash cards and label each one Combing, suffix, prefix as a lot are reused each chapter. Also, learn both sides of the cards. Do the extra credit. I had  % going into the final.\n",

Milich gives 33% of the students  grades ranging from F to C+.   32 % earned from B- to B+. 35 % earned grades ranging from A- to A+. These numbers are constant every year. Talk about arbitrary grading, that is Milich for you.\n",

            "Professor Bilotkach is great. He consistently updates his class via e-mail about whats going on. Generous curves. Tests definitely need studying, go to his office hours and review sessions. Review his notes and read the book. Received an A+, 98% on midterm, and  % on final with curves.\n",
            "This proffessor gave me a C instead of B when I was off by less than a 1 % and she doesn't even let u get back your scantrons to double check your results which makes it impossible to know whether their was a grading error or not.

            "3 Exams. No Quizzes. 2 easy Reflection Papers, which are based on personal opinion. Some extra credit given. Lots of reading, but you're not tested on it. Instead you are required to tell him what % of the reading you did. Very fair, straightforward clear. Easy, but valuable class. He has an accent, so I'd sit in the front. I recommend him.\n",
            "Just 2 exams...each counts 50 % so you really have to study for these 2 exams. Exams are difficult but if you study you will be fine. He is very entertaining and funny and wants everyone to do well. You should take him!\n",
            "Let me start off by saying Biroc is the bomb.Im taking him in the summer right now,and I have  %.I  read the book, study his lectures a lil bit.As long as you pay attention in class, which won't be hard at all,you'll do good.We get 4 tests and a final, each test is worth 50 pts, and the final is   pts. Take this class, it's the best.\n",
            "Enthusiastic and inspiring lectures. Material may be challenging for those with limited experience in programming. That being said, Antonios is good at explaining things. Home tasks were difficult and constitute a large % of overall grade. Prof. always comes to class in a good mood and answers all questions. Hes also great with office hours.\n",
            "The lectures are pretty easy to tune out on Mondays so good thing theres an outline of power points but if you show up on time on Wednesdays he reviews what was talked about pretty quickly and he makes sure to do a fun interactive activity. Watch out for when the quizzes are and show up ontime on those days. Cant make them up and big % of grade\n",
            "Very tough course for me. She is really encouraging and nice. Goes out of her way to help students who try, including giving take home portions of exams and lots of extra credit points (including up to 6 whole %age points on your final grade). But count on LOTS of study homework time.\n",
            "Easy A. All assignments add up to  %!! He offers opportunities for free points in midterms. Allows notes during exams and drops lowest midtermexam score. If you're not a STEM major and you need a Math class for IGETC, I highly recommend this one. It's quite easy, and with his short history lessons, interesting as well.   would take again. \n",
            "this class is not for someone who isnt into politics. he sends u articles to read almost everyday and tests are tricky.  your grade is only from 3 exams. two of them with an essay that is 70 % of your grade.  grades them tough and the MC are tricky.   i would avoid this class if i were u.\n",
            "She is a good Professor, but she has no human being quality. She will e-mail job openings, will give u good advice, but when it comes to grade she is horrible.. for eg if the student is on 79 % she will give him C. If the student needs C and he is on 69 she will give D. inspite the student knows the stuff but messed up in one of her exams. D \n",
            "I was really looking forward to taking Tim. My interest was kinda shot when his wife had her baby and I just lost focus having another teacher come in for 3 weeks and than Tim came back to whatever we were working on. The class was not hard it was me I could have been more focused. Tim to me is a total 5 thumbs up, he rocks and he knows his S#$%.\n",
            "This professor takes a lot of flack for his rigidity. I would not recommend his classes for anyone looking to get an easy A. With that said, it is clear that he gives  %. I recommend his classes for anyone who places educational value over relative easiness. I love the role-play.\n",
            "Tavss is by far the best chemistry professor at Rutgers. The man knows his stuff! He's so dedicated to helping his students get the best grade possible. He seriously puts in  % effort!

            "I LOVE Hai He!! He is the best teacher that I have had at Hunter and would  % recommend that you take his class.  He is an awesome teacher and really cares if his students learn.

            "Articles are a pain b/c he'll give you 25 and only 5 will be on the test. Some test questions refer back to things he say in class that aren't on the ppt slides so attend if you want an A. Read the articles and study slides for about an hour b4 the exam and you'll be fine. 4 exams, 25 questions = 25% of grade. Max 6 extra credit % points.\n",
            "Lectures can be a bit dry, but it's worth it. Provides a variety of different assignments that are worth less % so students can bring their grade up, which is a GIFT in Art History. VERY fair marker and will always help you whenever. Takes it upon herself to send you books that she thinks will help your paper specifically. Answers e-mails quickly.\n",
            "I thought this would be an easy elective class, however, I was wrong.  The assignments are ridiculous, and he expects WAY too much in 7 weeks. Some of the major assignments include a news log submission, Cultural Observation assignment (5 Indian 5 pages about % Indian events you went to) a 5 hr movie (2 exams on it). I would avoid.\n",
            "He is a prime example of an why I think many older gentlemen are awesome.  He is crystal clear  %, perhaps too much (repetitive speaking), but perhaps that is good for those who struggle.\n",
            "He's probably a genius, but a drawback is he knows it therefore there's no class input at all unlike any of my other Eng classes--just lecture, which is funny sometimes, but usually boring.Tests are THE hardest english tests I have ever taken: 60 point essays, plus 20 mult. choice w/ an average % in the 60's-70's! VERY hard, but grades on  curve!\n",
            "I started out where i like this guy..then I realized his notes totally contradicted themselves as the lectures went on making the tests very confusing. He gives a ton of notes with nitty gritty info and only tests you on like 15 % of the notes. Don't get the Text if you attend the lectures. You need to be in class because he doesn't post the notes!\n",
            "Class isn't bad. But now you take the final in class not online so beware of that. She rarely resoponds to emails and if she does they aren't helpful. Take iwth someone else, she's awful. Took practice test, said it was for a grade ( %) but now it's not.\n",
            "Laurie is a great teacher, she has a passion for math. However, this is a HARD CLASS. She is helpful, but you have to put  % into the class if you really want a good grade. LOTS of hw, and tests require hours studying. Make sure you know your trig, you're gonna need it. Overall good teacher, but hard class.\n",
            "I loved Mr. Keely! If you are an art student I think this class is for you. Many people said he was vague about assignments but he's doing that because its a creative art class! That's what art is all about anyway! Truly had so much fun in this class and loved the creative freedom we had.  % would take him again.\n",
            "She is the best prof in the English Department!! I hate to say it but she's REALLY REALLY HARD but really good. Class discussions are awesome, so you'll really want to go to class. She's always willing to help, no rewrites for a better grade. Your writing will drastically improve and she grades on growth, not %. you'll be happy she does that.\n",
            "Extremely long winded in his lectures, although I feel they are very clear, easy grader on tests, have to do 1 big group presentation at end of semester, only hw is rdg book, sliding scale for grading on tests (ur best test = highest % of final grade, worst = lowest)\n",
            "Dr. Jessee is an extremely knowledgeable man on his subject and cares about teaching the material.  If you do take him, make SURE that you take notes on  NEARLY everything he says, as the tests are based almost 100 % on his lecture, as the entire class period consists of lecture.  Overall, great guy.\n",
            "Extremely demanding professor, expects students to do graduate level work. Only allows one class absence with 3 % doc each following absence. I would not recommend taking unless you are committed to learning about Chinese politics. Moreover, he does not tell you what your final exam will consist of so you cannot prepare. Lack of relating to student\n",
            "very well informed. take notes, and study hard. i thought the quizes asked to many trival questions (%'s of groups infected, etc). brought in great speakers. really got me excited to go back to school to learn! going on to sfsu because her passion for what she does really put the flame in my bunson burner, so to speak.\n",
            "Funny, making lecture interesting to listen to. Willingly explained any questions I had, even enjoyed them. Tests are pretty hard, mix from book, lecture, and lab material. Required to remember equations. He has low total points, so try to finish all assignments if you want decent grade (e.g. lose 10 on 50 is huge %). Grade on curve.\n",
            "He is an okay person but test are hard as *#@% and Dr. D is way better he should just teach hte entire semster\n",
            "This online course is easy as hell. 5 assignments that are opened every 2 weeks, answers are very easy to find. I think he changed his previous curriculum which is why there are some negative reviews in previous years. no final! no midterm! i may have gotten  % TAKE TULLY\n",
            "He knows what he is teaching, very funny and has a good sense of humor. as for the class, it is hard , lab are long and too much work. two exams need to score 40 % in both to pass the course. study his notes online. overall i had a great experience.\n",
            "I am a 4.0 engineering student. To paint a clear picture, I scored a  % on my calculus 2 test but can't seem to get a passing test grade in this class. He barely teaches and only provides equations to specific situations and then changes the situation on the test. We went over 2 chapters and took a midterm on those two chapters the next class.\n",
            "Decently interesting class. Sometimes a bit tough to follow, but you can always go back and watch the lecture again. Tests are what you expect, and assignments are pretty easy I actually got  % on 3 assignments.\n",
            "great teacher! cheat sheets and calculator and tells you what problems will be on the test. i'm still taking the class right now, but so far it's great! 100% on my first quiz and  % on first exam. but i must say, do the hw! it really helps. if you done at least get a B in his class it's because you aren't studying hard enough!\n",

            "Yes, he's very monotone in his video lectures, but in live classes he's pretty funny. He does time you during presentations, so practice beforehand! There is a semester long group project which requires you to meet with group members outside of class frequently - take this seriously, it's a good % of your final grade and you can easily do well!\n",
            "This class is so easy and fun. I got  % on the first test because I actually studied. Then I realized all u have to do is take notes he writes on the board because he tells u every single thing that will be on the test and its OPEN NOTES. And he goes over the exact answer for the essay question. Easiest class ever and super interesting.\n",
            "A great teacher.  She is clear and helpful and really wants her students to learn.  She sticks to Spanish 90+% of the time, and only switches to English when people aren't getting it.  Her class is not hard, but you learn both language and culture.\n",
            "Wanna make an A here is the list do the sample problems in the text book, do all the problems he assigns and definitions he tells you to review before the exam. Labs are like 15 % of the grade which is easily do able. Great teacher overall.\n",
            "Good teacher but watch out if she doesn't like you.  I gave this class   % but she went out of her way to make my time there miserable.\n",
            "He's a VERY VERY VERY nice teacher. Lectures are boring but somewhat useful. If you don't go, make sure you read the books. Tests are T/F/Uncertain and explain a statement. Class is EASY because like a third of the class is group hw, and the other % are the tests. DO HW!! it will save you! CURVED CLASS!\n",
            "really easy! helps you a lot! lets you turn in late work. easy grader. essays are 50 % of your grade, so he grades hard on those.\n",

            "This is the best teacher i ever had i don't know why she has bad comment the ones who say bad things are the slackers She is so nice sweet old lady she has her attiuted sometimes but best teacher in the world no book required slack as hell and all her test are super easy i recommend her 100 % take her she is good trust me she is good easy fun.\n",

            "Not an easy teacher; to get an A on a project you really need to have a moment of inspiration in what you are doing, but B+s are attainable with hard work.  He actually gives a damn about the students and pushes you to do your best.  Recommended, but only if you are willing to give it  %, otherwise you won't do well.\n",
            "She is the coolest and most fun english teacher you can have. My friend had her for   and   and said she rocked for both, I unfortunately only had her for  . (My   teacher was a *$%#). She helps you write about things that interest you, and the final was fun and it was a good way to end the quarter.\n",
            "Reid is so nice. The class is beyond easy but its because he wants everyone to pass. He is so funny which makes class interesting and most of the time the quizzes aren't even given he just uses the clicker to take attendance. He picks good movies for us to watch and is willing to do anything for someone to pass. I left this class with  %.\n",
            "ESL   was my first class in GCC. It wasn't easy, but he really challenged me and I learned crucial things which helped me to get  % in ESL   easy. If anyone wants to improve his/her English seriously, take this guy and I promise you will be happy at the end.\n",
            "I got a 72% on the final and still had  % in the class.  Need I say more\n",
            "How can you people say that That was the EASIEST class in the world!! I got  % and didn't even need to take the final. He gives you the exam before hand. You have to TRY and fail.\n",
            "Literally, all you have to do is study the old tests. All questions are taken of them and if you do, you WILL get an A. I got a  % in his class. You even get to use your notebook for the second part of his tests, so you can right down all the questions from the old tests for that part.\n",
            "VERY COOL TEACHER BUT TOUGH GRADER. IF YOUR 1 % AWAY FROM AN A HE WONT GIVE IT. STUDY OR EXPECT A BAD GRADE\n",
            "Doesn't care if you pass or not. He is there to teach only. For a first year course, it is very challenging, with three labs, 6 mini-tests and one midterm, but still a final of 50 %. He expect you to know general knowledge for his exams! ridiculous! he want you to read one book a week (about 100 pages), as if we are studying only this course!\n",
            "I had Joan for a 2 week intensive MBA accounting class and she taught long days and put in  % energy. She's bright and interesting. Excellent note and high interest in student success. Awesome accounting professor.\n",

            "Easiest math class ever, I had  % at one point in the middle of the semester. I don't know why people would drop this class. His style of teaching is questionable but as a person he is approachable.\n",
            "Easiest class ever, if you can get past the poorly written book and have friends help you with the online quizes. I was able to flunk one of the two tests, and still get a  %!!!\n",
            "HAHA I loved Koelle. He is crazy but in a good way. He would be lecturing and then remember something and start talking about his life. Really fun and funny. I did everything I was asked and had like an  % at the begining, it helped at the end. If you have a 90% or higher you dont have to take the final. Always willing to help.\n",
            "Very cool teacher, teaches alot of tricks i would have never known.  He drops either your lowest test or all of your quizes if they are lower than your low test.  All homework is done out of the book, his math lab hours are only 50 minutes.  I went into the final with a  % very easy class if you do what your supposed to.\n",
            "Show up to class, use his study guides for the exams, and you'll pass. Easy A. Lectures range between dull/boring to funny/interesting. Shows a LOT of videos. He is very clear in what he expects from you, and repeats those expectations very often. He also offers around 15 points of extra credit on each exam. I finished the class with around a  %.\n",
            "Like everyone else has mentioned, he is a bit cantankerous. I attribute it to the fact that he has been teaching 3 classes a day for the last 40 years or so.  His grading is straightforward and the tests are a piece of cake if you study a bit. I don't think I got below  % on any of them.\n",
            "Prof. G. made this boring class really interesting. I wouldn't have gone to class if it was any other professor. She's extremely fair and makes the students interested in the subject. Recommend  %!\n",

            "Bruce is great. The QuickBooks assignment is a joke it's so easy (and it's a big % of your grade). His lectures are great, he always lets us out super early.

He drops at least two of everything (homework, and clickers, and OLAs) and the final is optional. His quizzes are basically the clicker questions. luv him\n",
            "I have no idea why people bit_h about him.He is a very smart teacher, knows to much for is own good.He is not hard at allll. For econ u get 4 take home tests worth 40% of ur grade, a 2 page paper(20%)a mid term(20%)and a final(20%)+ if you dont miss a class he adds 2 1/2 % to ur final grade.PS1 is just a joke its so easy..i got 3A's from him\n",

            "Although I won't use as harsh of words I am in agreement with the lenghty statement about trusting what he says. He did not give any attendance pts to a few student whe were a % or two from passing the cource and had to drop the program...HARSH! So i guess atendace isnt mandatory.\n",
            "He is the most amazing man and teacher you will ever meet. if you have your opinions feel free to make them in his classes just be sure that you can back what you say up. i would recommended him  % for anyone. all you have to do is write papers and most everything is negotiable.\n",
            "There are lots of homework due before the test and I do not recommend doing it last minute because the homework helps with the future test. If you go to Mesa chem4 tutoring , he will give extra credit. He curves all the test and if you ask him for help, he will help. BUT he will go off topic. Many people dropped. Right now, I have 87 % in the class\n",
            "he is horrible he has no desire to teach what so ever, you won't learn nothing in this class. your final grade is based only on test only which makes it very hard to pass this class since you don't learn S#%&t. DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!\n",
            "Nice old man. Knowledgeable and passionate. Goes over every aspect in the readings so it can be boring at times. You can make it interesting by participating. Participation attendance is a large % of your grade.\n",

He did a plaster-mold-making demo with his back to the class so only a few kids could see what he was doing. His attitude is arogant, questions from students annoy him.  Basically he's a big important artist who doesn't give a #%&!! about teaching.\n",

Also, she gives grade % points extra credit on random days to those who show up, EC also for experiments TESTS: only read parts of the book that are referred to in notes, remember examples, use full page for a cheat sheet, tests are curved a few questions, she may drop a test at end\n",
            "If you get a chance to take him, do everything in your power to. If you have a pulse and one finger to type with, you will get an A. 2 hour class lasts 45 minutes, you essentially get  % on the midterm and final if you attend almost all classes, and he will bash your poor work but give you A anyway. Great teacher person and class. Cant say enough\n",

He is the nicest professor in the galaxy. If you don't put in at least 30 Hours / Week don't take him. You WILL fail.. unless there is an SI, then 2-10 is fine.\n",
            "Incredibly easy. I skipped twice a week and I got a  %. Tons of extra credit. If you haven't lived under a rock your entire life, you'll pass this class. The tests are listening to a sound clip determining whether or not it's The Beatles. Seriously? Take this class.\n",
            "This is literally the only class I have ever taken in my life where you can get a grand total of  % for the semester. Jesus Christ, the class is so easy and the extra credit so bountiful you have got to be braindead to get less than at LEAST an A in this class.\n",

Did I mention that his study guides give you the extra credit questions to memorize? There are five assignments for the class, and if you don't turn them all in you can't pass. So study and do the assignments.\n",

            "Great teacher, really hard class. I found that I had to read the book as well as take good notes during lecture to do well on exams. His tests are brutal, but he is fair about throwing out questions if a large % miss them. He takes a subject that's very dull and makes lecture interesting. I enjoyed this class much more than I thought I would.\n",

            "If there is another teacher teaching math 5 - choose him instead. If you have no choice, don't worry. Kavinoky is a difficult teacher and his lectures are hard to follow, BUT he does make up for it by extending the % range for getting an A, B, etc. (ie, A: 100-85%, B: 84-75%). I got D's on several of my tests but he still gave me a B in the class.\n",

HE IS THE WORST EVER\n",
            "I DO NOT recommend taking this class over the summer, let alone with this teacher. No notes or anything. He straight lectured and most the time it seems like he's lecturing to himself bc he'll start mumbling. Doesn't make it interesting at all.

Yeah college should be challenging, but 5 books and tests are take home essays that you couldnt get an A on if witnissed what happened in history. Totally went ape &*$% when a phone went off once. Take Locke, much better teacher than this krazy KOOK.\n",
            "This guy threw a piece of chaulk at some guys head! It was funny as hell. Besides that, this class was possibly the most boring one I've taken. Very smart but can't teach. Purposefully uses big words sometimes just to f$%k with the students. HAHA **** You\n",

We spent 4wks on the Russian Rev but didnt really cover the Russians. 2wks on HitlerChurchill but didn't cover WWII in Europe or the Holocaust beyond saying other countries were to blame. Class itself was easy. 3 short papers  final. No clear grading criteria or what % each assignment was.\n",
            "In terms of doing well in theclass, focus on exams. The class is broken up to just quizes and exams. I averaged 50-60% on quizes and that was with some study at the MLSC, he grades very strictly. If you do the homework and understand each problem the exam is a breeze, I 100%-ed two and one of them I got a  %. He gives hints on whats on the exam.\n",
            "What I like to call gameshow-style teaching. 50% of the final grade was dedicated to quizzes each trivia style question of the quiz worth 1 %of final grade!! Ridiculous! DICKinson has something to PROVE not to teach!\n",
            "She is very easy, just do homework and keep notebook on point and you'll be str8. I endedd up with a  % final grade in her class and trust me it wasnt that hard!!One more thing, she is still probablly chewing on that piece of gum!\n",

            "Entertainingly good lecturer. Tends to cover things a bit too quickly, but is always engaging and presents tons of incredibly interesting videos, images, and ideas in general. Talks about his own work frequently. Powerpoints always available outside lecture and extremely useful for studying. Exams are hard as hell (good for a %ile grading system).\n",

He only covers stuff that will be on exams( unlike others) Although his lectures are pretty boring, if you keep up taking notes a lot of the examples given will be similar to the ones on the exams! 4 exams 1 final. you can choose to do hw on the board to have the % on the final less. I would def. retake him!\n",
            "Lectures are interesting, but there's so much material that it's hard to determine what's important. 3 exams (30ish% each) - 15 MC Q's (30%) and an essay (70%). TA grades essays and expects graduate level work. You can miss up to 10 classes, but phones and laptops are not allowed in class (makes it hard to take notes). Take someone else if you can.\n",

When I was sitting in the front I couldn't hear what she was saying and since she does lots of notes on the board you can't hear what she said w/ it. Lots of mistakes in handouts. I noticed % changes on things like an assignment from 4.9 to 6.7%\n",
            "Dr. Rachal is hard on his students because he wants them to reach their full potential.  I would not be the student I am now if he had not demanded  % from me.

            "Vankirk is a fabulous math teacher. Prior to this class I would fail math on all accounts -- I never understood any of it. I left her class with a constant  % all semester, no joke.

No textbook for the class but you do have to buy the My Math Lab online, in order to complete your homework. If you do well throughout the semester and maintain an A or B average in the class, you don't have to take the final exam!\n",

First exam, average score was 50 %. He spent an hour scolding us, never admitting he had a role in it. He NEVER covered test/textbook material in class. Old. Big ego\n",
            "Very good instructor, informative and very very helpful.  The only way you can't pass this class is to NOT show up.  He gives more than  %, has extra study sessions (on HIS time).  Great sense of humor and very easy going. Love you Mr. Martin!\n",
            "Mr. Bill was a nice professor.  Assignments and tests are not difficult. Attendance isn't mandatory since you can watch the Echo  videos.  As long as you watch the videos and study a little you should be okay.  There were also 10 pop quizzes throughout the semester that counted as extra credit if you were in class. I made  % in this class\n",
            "Wow... I am surprised to see such poor reviews for Professor Eng. Her class was SO EASY! Go to class, take notes, get an A. I am not an A student normally. I have very little interest in the subject. Yet my final grade was upwards of  %. Your entire grade is based on 2 exams! They are both open book open note. Test s are covered in class!\n",

Definitely take him for an easy A!\n",

Anyone who didn't get  % out of this class only has themselves to blame. He's an excellent teacher who completely changed the way I work in 3d. His class is NOT easy though. He asks a lot of you.\n",
            "I thought his grading system was great. If you study and do the homework you will do great. I got a  % in that class its easy. His practice tests are great. You know he cares when he goes over every test to make sure you get it. Homework sucks but this is college, homework comes standard.\n",

He uses a point system for grades meaning you have to have a certain number of points for an A/B/C etc. Your % could be an A but if you don't have the number of points you won't get it. He gives study guides that have the exact same questions as the exams lol.\n",

She is amazing...gives out tons of extra credit, allows cheat sheets on a few of the exams, is a very helpful, down to earth girl who bike races all the time.  Best student teacher ever.  Very fun class.  I would probably have  % in this class if it were allowed.\n",

There was an assignment involved worth a big % of grade, but if you start it right away like she advises you to then you shouldn't have a problem(she hands it out like first or second class). This class is very manageable and if you attend class you'll do really well.\n",

            "Our class averaged 25% for his exams prior to the final (no i'm not exaggerating and yes you're reading that correctly), thusly grades are determined by class ranking with a certain % getting A's, B's, etc. Either his exams were incredibly difficult or we're retards. I'm going to have to say a little of both. Nice guy but an inexperienced teacher.\n",

He only gave two tests all semester, so if you bomb one you probably wont get higher than a C.  He assigns homework but is very unclear about what % it counts toward your grade.  I like Pavlicek, but the syllabus needs to be clearer.\n",

            "Really easy class! Lectures can be boring but he has good stories and on good days is really funny. Kind of behind on technology, literally writes on notebook paper under the doc cam, but teaches you the essentials without the BS so it's a lot easier to understand. Every test has 2 extra credit questions, I ended up with  %. I'd recommend him!\n",

She comes from a strong business background and expects the best from her students.

She is very open minded, and her lectures are always very interesting.\n",

Don't be afraid of the online quizzes, you can take them a thousand times until you get 100 % and they are questions right off the tests (they all together equal 1 whole letter grade). He was very sweet and helped me pass this tough class.\n",
            "BEWARE: for those of you that are not self reliant in math and you need a good detailed instructor she is not recommended. Her tests are awesome for those of you that can depend on yourselves to pass the class.Her tests are always out of  %. she very boring and does not explain material very well.\n",
            "Hard. She is entertaining but very demanding of her students. She expects a  % if you wanna get even close to an A. This would be fine if she wasn't so inconsistent in her teaching style. I found this class to be one of the most difficult and painful at MCC. However, I did take French   like 3 years prior to taking this class.\n",
            "Bob was a source of frustration all semester.  He is a vague, worthless lecturer, and he tests on material not discussed in lecture.  His conceptual approach is inefficient and confusing.  At some points during exams, I was quoting passages from the book as if 8B was an english class!  Get a good GSI, b/c you won't learn s%*# from this guy.\n",

Guarentee either movie or powerpoint!\n",

            "Course requirements and the % of grade that they were worth changed during the semester.  Considerable amount of homework.  It took me a good share of 2 days to finish the grammar assignments each week (only one part of the assignments). In her defense, I believe I was in her first class so I suspect as she gains experience she will get better.\n",
            "Over emphasizes her bias,  omits essential information she disagrees with.  Entertains you with videos rather than teaching pracitcal content. She totally squanders the opportunity to teach interesting topics that are relevant to teaching.  If she was paid according to the value of what was taught she would earn at best 15 % of her salary.\n",
            "I loved English before but now i don't.this professor made me realize you have to put in  % to get an A. Grades very  difficult;Attendence is mandatory;ZERO extra credit. Take this professor if you are willing to go through hell\n",

            "The good thing is that he will try and make sure you have a passing grade in the class (C or higher) and helpful on the labs.  The bad thing is that he lecture so long that more than likely, you won't even care what he says and probably study the book and pray to your god that his tests is easy or just study for the final sine he will switch %'s.\n",
            "possibly the worst college experience. i'm a 3.9 student and you would think that history would be easy. but this B%*ch made this class impossible. for this class all she does is stand in one place and she starts blabbing. 5 essays. 5-7 pages and that it, but grades unfairly if she disagress with you. DONT take her, the worst teacher ever\n",
            "VERY easy class. Her study guides are literally her exams. I never took notes or studied and I passed with  % in the class. Very nice lady. She does count attendance by asking you an art question - you write your name and answer on a sheet of paper and that counts as attendance. \n",

            "This lady needs to be fired ASAP. 90 % of the time nobody understands her. Ive talked with all my fellow classmates and they all agree that she's a terrible teacher.

            "Simulation is tough. Put in the hours, do all the extra problems you can find, and get a GREAT project group. Find old tests to study or you will be blindsided by the tests. The project took more time than anything I have done in college for % of grade.\n",
            "He is a nice guy, but I would not recommend it if you are not willing to put a  % effort into your writing. Prof.O is available to talk to if you need help and some guidance, which was very unhelpful in my opinion. He based his grade on the first 2 pages of each assigned paper. If you do not want your GPA to suffer do not take this class.\n",
            "nice old man, but you cant ask him questions cause he either doesnt hear you or doesnt understand, quizzes and tests are hard, completely reworded definitions that make no sense, some how i bombed all the tests but got an A in the class bcause he uses a point system instead of % which is great, if you can stay awake take him because he is BORING.\n",

            "Prof. Comins is a very serious person who is all business at first, but is really great once you get to know her. Textbook is not specifically used but can be helpful. Tests can be difficult. Homework is very reasonable, but make sure you put in  % effort because she is a tough grader and will take points off.\n",
            "He's pretty good. My biggest beef, when he asks for suggestions from the class he'll go with anything even if it doesn't work, and then will show you why. It can confuse you really quick. Also pay attention to the details here and there and don't make any assumtions unless absolutely  % sure!\n",
            "I hated this guys class but its give and take, you either hate him or you love him... Hes an attendence Nazi. not being  absent once Thats unrealistic, S*%@ happens and theres no way to make up the attendence cause the community service extra credit doenst apply to attendence.\n",
            "You only have to write 2 page papers. Quiz on your reading right when class starts. She's not a fair grader though. Your quizes don't boost up your grade but will hinder them if you don't do them. Her grading is not based on points or %, it's based on how she feels about you. Horrible grader.\n",

            "Prof. Hearn is awesome. She explains EVERYTHING very well and will definitely help you with any problems you have. On all our exams, she gave ridiculous curves or other opportunities to improve your grade. One test went from a 58 to a  . I ended the class with probably a  % and felt like I knew everything. Everyone else did bad tho so idk.\n",
            "His lectures were 3 hours long, but he still managed to not make them boring. His tests were tough, especially more towards the end of the semester, but he offers a lot of extra credit (everything adds up to  % and he gave 40 possible points of EC on the final). Not super tough, but a good professor for the course and a very accomplished one.\n",
            "She gave so much extra credit I ended up with  % in her class.  She is interseting and if you do your part she will do everything in her power to help you pass.  Expect a quiz every week.  She is nice and explains topics very well.\n",

            "I LOVED HIM! I got a  % in his class, because he gives out extra credit almost every week. If you go to class, and take the quizzes and practice exams, there will be no surprises on the tests. Also, you don't have to take the final if you have a 90% or better, so that's a definite incentive. Overall, GREAT teacher!!!! And entertaining as well !\n",
            "HIGHLY recommended if you are interested in concise learning. The woman knows her st%&f. Its Fall   and she is currently teaching NINE composition classes. She is an author.

If you dont have to take this class , dont take it .\n",
            "Fastidious, but not fickle!  I thought that his expectations were clearly spelled out from Day #1 and remained consistent.  He's tough, but very helpful and fair.  Interesting and funny, too!  Gives  % and expects you to do the same.  A nice guy you can respect.\n",
            "Went to class for participation points that's all. Quizzes were simple if you understand programming concepts. Midterms and Final tests were the easiest just the quiz questions. The programming mid/final were simple if you did the labs. lots of extra credit, I didn't take the final and got  %. Labs 1.5-2hr, 3-5 if you're new to programming.\n",

Nothing is more of a pain in the ass than trying to get a discussion going and no one talks. Course grade is determined by average of professor, TA, and other group leaders. Group Leader gives % of that #.\n",

He show you what his test actually look like. Posts power points, old test, and lots of other useful information.\n",
            "I took the Mus 20 honors class and it was a joke. I never once opened the book or studied for any of the tests. This is because if you attend the extra credits (up to 72 extra credit points) and show up everyday (100 pts), all you need to get are F's on the tests to get an A in the class. I finished with a  %.\n",

            "Robert shows the class how to do basic problems in lecture and assigns some problems in the book.  Then at test time he turns up the difficulty to the harder problems in the book that he didn't go over or assign. The average on our first test was 22%.  He said the average is usually in the 40ish% range and didn't know why ours was so different.  So, for a passing grade, you might try another school for it; if you can't, then doing all the problems in the book might get you there too.\n",

            "He was an awesome teacher. Very energetic and funny. He runs around the room like a crazy man telling stories and picking on people for being hungover! His tests were easy and he gave extra credit. I ended up with a  % in his class!\n",
            "Gets students to focus and understand.  Real life.  Funny.  Available by phone to help out.  Gives  % to make class understanding and enjoyable.  (If you don't like to do homework, or be prepared for this class, take another class.)\n",
            "Great class experience, this guys knows a hell a lot about Finance. Does not use the text book that much. Had to do service learning or do a 10 pg paper and a presentation. Tests are extremely hard but he gives an 'A' fr 86. 3 tests but you can decide what % to allocate which test. I literally got an A even b4 the finals. Loves Sam Adams. Must Take\n",

            "Very smart but boring at times. When he tell jokes, nobody gets it because he uses the same tone. He knows his material and he can back what he talks  %. If you are in networking, then take his classes and make sure you pay attention. I just wish he took a course in beeing more alive.\n",
            "Amazing Prof, He's very entertaining. he's also crystal clear. I learned a lot from him. He helped me out anytime I needed help. He's puts  % so you can learn. His tests are a little hard, but if you go to class and pay attention you will learn because he is a Genious!\n",
            "Really nice guy and likes to joke around, but the grading scale seemed a bit unfair.  I guess if you're fine with a B or C you should take this class, but otherwise, it's pretty hard to get an A.  His class needs 96+% for an A and 48-% for an F.\n",
            "My favorite professor at Miami! Very lively and knows a lot from experience. He tells you EXACTLY what will be on the exams (except dept. final) so if you study what he says,its easy to get an A.Also, curves so much that i got around  % on one exam.\n",
            "worst math teacher ever. i had to drop the class. does not explain anything. He even walked out on our class for talking.. just got up and left. DO NOT TAKE HIM class average was a 27.% a 40% would get you a B. terrrible.\n",
            "Because everyone has to give speeches, you get to know your classmates very quickly. We only had to give 3-4 speeches and you're given plenty of time. She requires an outline before each speech, but you can use note cards. Overall, super fun and a class I looked forward to. If X% of students do the evaluation, you won't have a final.\n",
            "i took her online class in spring 05. I thought i was getting an A because the grading scale is rite there, but at the end she multiplied everything by 20&. So even if you do perfect on quizez like i did, i had a  %, but got C and a B on final and midterm, you would get a B+,,,i do recommend her but just be aware of the grading scale.\n",
            "She's a wonderful ballroom teacher! Very upbeat and patient, willing to break things down if you're not quite getting it. The class is always a fun and comfortable learning environment. Never a dull moment! I recommend her intermediate ballroom class  %!!!\n",

            "He is the hardest professor i have to this day, you can put forth  % effort, study, prepare and he will still give you poor grades. I have a 3.87 overall GPA, always make straight A's and made a C with him. To give my review credibility; I am a UT Austin pre-law student. I take core classes at LSC.\n",
            "T1 C+ and T2 B+. In position where if I get a 100 on T3 I still end up with an 89.x%. He's ok but my philosophy has been: \"go to class + do homework + study = earn an A\". I did all that and will end with a B or B+. Barely anyone gets As on tests(MC + essay) even though we study and go to class. Not hard tests; just hard to get an A on them.\n",
            "Very humorous. Excellent teacher and flight instructor. Light on homework in class. Just watch the research paper. This is the one area he's picky on. Make sure you use the correct format (usually APA) or you'll get a 0.%. Lots of knowledge and practical experience. One of the best.\n",
            "I had him for at least four classes and after XX yrs I can tell you he was and is one of the best professors I ever had. Definitely UoH is a better school just because of him. I would suggest everyone to take a class with him.  He is smart, challenging, inspiring, knowledgeable, helpful, fun. Only scores  % in my book A++++++\n",
            "This class was a breeze. Took it for 8 weeks online and it was only one module a week. She includes so many extra credit opportunities, it's almost unreal. The first week of class I had a  % because of her EC. Some modules are heavy on reading and research, but having a full week to get it done was nothing. Super down to earth, too.\n",
            "this lady is a little crazy! wouldn't choose to have her again unless she was the only teacher. and no i'm not saying this out of bitterness, i finished the semester with  %! But her lectures kill you..and she thinks movies are the answer to everything\n",
            "She is a wonderful person who is funny and is willing to help you succeed. She grades on 4 exams strictly on a % basis. She takes into account attendance and participation as part of to determine ones final grade.\n",
            "Obviously very knowledgeable about his field, but I found lectures to be somewhat boring-- 1oo% of his notes are on the overhead. He is extremely helpful in the lab, really wants you to succeed, but that being said he grades extremely tough (especially on labs) and his tests are not easy. I was surprised to find that this is not a blow off class.\n",
            "Dr. Brann is awesome, TAKE HER!!! It's already a difficult class, but having an understanding and wise teacher makes all the difference. Show up to lectures and take good notes- if she repeats anything it'll be on the test. Don't come late- ask detailed questions she hates vague questions. I recommend her  %.\n",

            "She ruined the subject matter for me. Even after putting in  % studying, completing all assignments and making an effort, she contradicts herself and grades accordingly. The connections to the readings were useless and did not help. Final Paper topic: either debate her on her life's work or get slammed in a simple topic.DO NOT TAKE\n",
            "I got around a  % in her intro to programming course. She was a good teacher that didn't tolerate laziness. She expected her students to act like the adults that we were. If it was too hard for some people then maybe they should become art majors.\n",
            "If you get anything but an A in this class, you should reevaluate your academic career. I got a  % in this class. Do the homework and the extra credit and you will get an A. \n",

Do not turn in lat homework she wont take.overall ask questions if you dont understand ask question about homework peoblems she will go over it. i got B for final grade cause i turn in all homework.test are 5-7 math problmes\n",
            "Gave 100%s on exams to 2 people for reciting small % of notes in class.Says he'd let us kick out lazy group members, but he didn't, so I ended up writing the report.Some exam 's NOT in notes/book.Left early for meetings(wasting tuition money).Sent STUDENT ASSIST. to give final.A not worth stress.\n",

            "First of all, the only people who bash Ben Neil on here are kids that are pissed off at their grades! He is by far one of the better teachers I've ever had and finds ways to make the class interesting. He says exactly what will be on the tests, you just have to show up and listen! #@$%ing awesome!\n",
            "I dread going to class every day, but there is so much extra credit that it's definitely easy to feel pretty set with everything in the class.  For me, i crapped it up on tests so far but got  % on quizzes and will do extra credit papers and probably end up with a B or higher.  Probably an A actually! haha.  boring, but easy.\n",
            "he comes off to be smart..but he is a liberal ...democratic ..candy coated person...whom is fake! i would like to see him take on rush limbaugh! or sean hannity! they both would eat him alive! vern should spend less time trying to bullsh%t people that he\n",
            "She's a great professor and  annually teaches MA96. Dr.Sun really knows her stuff. Two % of the grade is based on attendance participation. She gives a strong curve opportunities to raise your grade too. I'm very glad to have been one of her students. Keep in mind that MA96 has the highest attrition rate--so give it your all!\n",
            "Rich Kramer ayez was not a too good Prof. He demanded a lot of an online class, that was easy, but he refused to round my final grade up from A- to A, and the margin was off by .01 % !!!!!!!!\n",
            "Can't follow much of what she says in class. Tests are ridiculously hard. Team projects do not have any % to your final grade.\n",
            "Interesting guy and very knowledgeable but soooooo boring. Feel asleep in 95 % of his classes and I wasn't the only one (and they were all afternoon classes.) Lots of discussion which is nice. Takes forever to grade papers though. and exams are a little confusing - more than one answer possible on most multiple choices.\n",
            "So far the worst professor I had throughout my education. It took him two weeks to release the grades for online final exam. Plus no clear instructions on case term paper which was 40 % of your grade. This professor is really lazy as he doesn?t want to do any work at all.\n",
            "This is the toughest class I've ever taken!  However, it's also one of the few classes I've really been challenged in and taken a lot of useful information from.  Dr. Anderson expects 100% from everyone, and really you have to put in  % or more.  He also offers an awesome tutor that is wonderful at breaking down tough concepts.  Best of luck!\n",
            "Dr. Covey is relatively easy if you just read the book and use a little memorization, I guarentee that will be a B+.  Yes, his exam are F* hard but the thing is that in the end, his curve are good.  40% will get A and only 5 % will get F.  I got average of C on all exam and B- for final, I got an A for final grade.  Take lab too.\n",
            "Prof. Robertson is a brilliant man. He is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what he does/teaches. The class consists of: 3 exams (earn up to  %) 2 papers. Easy grader and offers a final exam to replace lowest test grade. The only complaint I have is that his slides are kind of sloppy. EXCELLENT professor overall. Highly recommended!\n",
            "Great prof.  Organized and respectful.  Exams based on how much you know, so there's a chance of always earning  - %; even if you don't do it all, you still have a chance of making 90-100 (A).  Great discussions, too.\n",
            "I LOVE THIS GUY! Even though he can be pretty serious, he is so jokes! His teaching is highly organized, his blackboard communication is fantastic! His TA's are INCREDIBLE! I'd also like to say that at every class he gives  % effort! Has a Wonderful teaching style is very clear as well as extremely helpful! Tips: Go see him at his office hours!\n",
            "Dr. Joe is the NICEST professor I have had at BGSU. He gives you the option of dropping several of your worst quizzes and is willing to go out of his way to help. The tests have a lot of material, but if you actually spend a little time and study, they are fairly easy. I ended up not having to take the final in there because of my % in the class.\n",
            "Daniel Lux was one of my favorite professors. If you ask for help, he'll be there and give  % to make you succeed. Very funny guy and he's very passionate about the material he teaches! If you like motorcycles, Football, the Ohio State Buckeyes, Geology, or need a lab science and avoided BIO100 like the plague (like me), I highly recommend him!\n",
            "Professor Skar is organized, prepared, and gives  %. She has changed the whole Spanish program. I learned more this year than in all my other classes. I recomend her -but only if you want to do the work. A lot of reading.\n",
            "Dr. Dix is awesome. P-Chem is curved to a B, so do ~10 % above average on exams and you're AROUND the A range (do as well as you can). Go to office hours, and if you can't, make appointments to see him and go over material. The class is difficult, but if you want to succeed it is quite possible.\n",
            "Do not take unless you want cog to be your life. Had a 4.0 in psy prior but that was ruined. Nearly impossible to do well. Only like 4 % the class has an A or like 6/ . Just as hard as orgo, calc 2 and calc based physics when it shouldnt be.\n",
            "She encourages class participation through words but not through actions. If you answer a question or raise a comment (as she encourages you to do) be prepared to be met with a comment slightly nicer than Are you some sort of F@#%ing idiot That is completely wrong!  Decent course material though.\n",
            "Very difficult, but that may have been the material and not her teaching style. any confusion in her class is best cleared up after class at her office. i felt like i understood everything from class  % once talking to her outside of class. understanding, and helpful, but at first glance her teaching is as decipherable as hieroglyphics.\n",
            "Jim's a hilarious prof and quite easy going. If you take this course remember attendance and participation matter and are an easy mark towards your final. Group project accounts for 25 % with heavy emphasis on solving a case and finding a solution, make sure you have detailed responses for a solid mark. The midterm and final is based of the notes.\n",

            "DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!!! SHE IS UNORGANIZED AND IS A TOTAL B*%@H. THE ONLY WAY I GOT THROUGH IT WAS B/C I HAD 3 YRS OF SPANISH ALREADY. IF U DO, KEEP ALL HANDOUTS AND MARK DWN DATES U MISS CLASS AND THE DATES OF QUIZES (VERY IMPORTANT) OR SHE WILL MESS U UP BIG TIME!!\n",

            "If you never had stress and would like some this is totally the class for you  % he could care less that he is not clear on his lecture no matter how much you complain, never follows the book yet gives quizzes weekly on each country, doesn't give outlines on the essays VERY hard grader he is unsure of himself and his lecture is not in the book\n",
            "GES   is an online course, so the only contact you will have with him is when you go to the lab for help.  When you go to lab, he is very willing to assist you.  MATLAB itself is a frustrating program, no matter who teaches it.  Lots of trial and error.  Put forth  %, and you'll do okay.\n",
            "I cant believe people are dissing my fav professor. He knows his S$%T! Apparently the people rating him expect to get everything handed to them (including the answers). Why dont these students start listening/understanding and stop memorizing.\n",
            "Pros:yes she's nice cares about students.cons: she doesnt know how to write good tests, instead of making them hard she makes them long. the averages are high so u need a 90something % to get an A. Not the greatest teacher but her notes are neat tidy. GO TO SEMINARS b/c she bases her exam q's off them. if u can, take bio with someone else.\n",

Also he loves having talks and it's common to see him having lunch with his students! I recomment him % !\n",
            "Trdan is my FAVORITE teacher! Class is VERY tough, you will need to study hard. Each test is curved. For Zoo study hard for the lab and it will bring your lecture grade up. My first lab exam had a 20 point curve (brought my test up to a  %) and kept me at an A in the class. Lecture tests are hard: know the material inside and out.\n",

            "fun class, but lousy grading system. I am a rather large person. The final exam is based on weight %. So if you are fat, then you have to lift more weight. So if you cannot bench press   pounds after a couple months, you fail. Dr. Allsen is a great, helpful guy, but the class needs a good workout!\n",
            "Rieann is an amazing professor.  Took   over the summer, and decided to take   this fall just to have her again.  Take GOOD notes and you will have no problems passing this class.

            "Dr Harper is an incredible professor. He is goofy and fun, and really makes the material easy to learn.

Ended up getting a  % in his class because of how he presented the material and prepared you.\n",
            "This class is fantastic! He keeps the lectures interesting and likes to have big class discussions.

            "This is the worst professor I have ever experienced. This is the first class I fail.

More 90 % of the class fail or either drop the class.No review for the test and the tests are all tricky.\n",
            "She is very hard to understand, take her only if you are be willing to practice the exercises like crazy at your house, otherwise you are hooked. I was the second highest in her class and I fot 77 % in the final. Can you emaging how hard it is\n",

I studied every waking minute to get the grade. Enough is never enough for this professor but he makes you learn the material in and out. Previous exams are NOT helpful so attending class is BEST!!\n",

She expects  % from each of her students, which can be quite difficult to achieve when you're taking other classes at the same time. If your work is not amazing and in the format that she wants, don't expect a passing grade. She also hates trees, so expect a LOT of unnecessary paperwork.\n",
            "His main flaw is lacks organization. Following this flaw, is that he teaches Civ Pro while in Torts class. Teaching of the second course results in not covering the Torts material. The material that was not covered laters appears on the exam compromising about 90% of the MC quesitons (which was a high % of the exam). Brewer should not be teaching.\n",

You can use your notes on tests (all essay), but she doesn't really tell you what she's looking for so grades can be hit and miss. Her grading scale is tougher than most, an A is 95 % and above.\n",
            "WOW! If u haven't taken a LEJ course with him, you ARE MISSING OUT! HE MAKES CLASS FUN beyond all belief! No wonder he has a PERFECT rating. The 3 exams are SO EASY! SO SO SO EASY!

Home work is huge % and easy.\n",

Only gives 2 tests the whole semeter, which are difficult, gives a quiz almost every single class which count for a high % of grade. Extremely vague about requirements, has no grading scales.\n",

            "Awesome Chem Prof! Had her for 1A and am extremely satisfied. She is very friendly and was easy to understand. Loves it when you come in for Office Hours and is a lot of fun. Does good job teaching a hard class.  Lectures off of PowerPoint slides that you can download, print and take notes on top of! Gives extra credit. I scored  % on 1st test!\n",

            "Honestly the greatest teacher in the world! knows her stuff!! Intrigues the class in her lecures, not to sound cliche but I state the truth. Generally I am a person that has a problem with speaking in front of people but now I can truly say after taking her class improved by  %... thank y0u lamond\n",
            "As long as you know her, please drop immediately. She is so hard and never keep promising. Mid test (60% got D and F). Final test (70 % of the class under 50% of   point). So you can imagine how hard she is\n",
            "Awesome! The only way to unlock the secrets of this instructors wealth of knowledge is to truly be seaking such. She has a true willingness to see you succeed, yet will not hold your hand to preform tasks that should be one's own responsibility.You have to give 100% for a  % return. So expect to work for a change, it'sworth it.\n",

            "I have had him now for 3 semesters straight so that?s got to mean something. Class consists of 3 tests (30 % each) and 2 assignments (5 % each). Tests are tough and only have about 30 MC/TF questions. You will need to study hard to pull of an A. you should go to class everyday. very difficult to teach yourself and Dr. Tamimi?s notes are great\n",
            "She loves administering essay questions for tests.  She grades them quite hard- much detail is needed, any detail left out will suffer heavy point deductions.  The multiple choice questions, which make the smaller % of test grades, aren't easy either.  She assigns a 2nd book on El Paso to read, too.\n",

            "I don't recommend her. She's vague about her assignments and is an exceptionally picky grader. She'll take points off for the most inconsequential things. She's (very) mildly helpful with conferences but those still didn't really help me all that much. I gave  % in this class and all it got me was a B-.\n",
            "Bottom line, this is the hardest class I've ever taken. I have friends that have other professors for this class and my personal advice would be to make sure u find yourself in one of them. No doubt she knows the material, super smart lady, but that really doesnt mean  #$% if 90% of the class would swear shes speaking Greek. whatever, good luck.\n",
            "Pretty dull prof, but also knows her stuff. A large % of your mark was based on participating through out the course, make sure you go to classes. Her final paper was very easy, and she is a fair marker. I'd suggest to read the textbook and go to class for her, I found her tests rather hard.\n",
            "Fantastic professor -- this guy will go down in history himself. Very kind and helpful. His tests are fairly easy and he gives a curve if  nobody gets a hundred (although someone got  % on his first midterm), but you have to study all of his lectures to ensure an A. I got by with the textbook but that was definitely the tough way to do it.\n",

Easy A if your shingon\n",

            "ok. this is actually one of the worst teacher's i've had in his test the average grading was a 20 to 30 % one of the worst teachers i've had if not the worst very hard you come to the final test withput knowing anything.i adive you dont take him you'll fail\n",
            "Fair grader, partial credit. Extra credit  % depending on day you take the test. For example, you take the test the first day it's offered an extra 8% to your test score, 2nd day available, extra 6% to test score etc.. HW not for grade. Lectures can be a tad confusing, he gets lost sometimes. Final was only a Chapter exam, not cumulative.\n",

            "I never gained much from the lectures, but I'd recommend going to class every day to earn points from the ten pop quizzes (I just sat in the back and worked on other things). For each test, practice the old tests he posts online until you're consistently getting 100s. DO THE BONUS PROJECT. Even if you have a  %, STUDY FOR THE FINAL or you'll fail\n",

            "AMAZING PROFESSOR. He's one of those rare one of a kind professors that change your entire perspective on a subject. I took him for statistics (I'm horrible at math) and received a  %, that is how great he is at teaching.He made class so enjoyable. Oh, and the only assignments are take home quizes every week that you can use notes on. TAKE HIM!\n",
            "heavy accent, funny. thinks himself is a genius, students are retards. dont take him unless u realy need da units. i had C in the class, my frd had A in other math 8(sure i know alot more than he does, cuz i taught him to do da hw). do not take him in win/sum sem, final % is 35% of total grade.\n",
            "He is a horrid lecturer and does not even finish all the problems he starts in class.  His curve is the most absurd thing I've ever seen, he takes your score over the average and divdes that by  % to figure out your score. . . .he should be fired.  Avoid him, especially if you have to take more chem after him.\n",
            "There's so much extra credit that i ended up with a  %. As long as you go to the lectures you'll easily pass the exams aren't really that hard as long as you remotely pay attention. I loved the class and she seemed really passionate.\n",
            "Prof. Laird is a very interesting guy, and a great lecturer. MUSC  is a very fun class and Laird's love for Broadway make it easy to enjoy the class. He is pretty tough in terms of exams and papers, though, so be ready to give  % or you won't do super well.\n",
            "Absolutely terrible. She speaks in Spanish 9. % of the time and her accent is super thick. Asking her a question is pointless because she CAN BARELY COMMUNICATE IN ENGLISH. Class is boring, and there's online homework every single week so you better utilize Google translate because she doesn't explain anything clearly.\n",
            "She will be no help, makes content  % harder than it needs to be. Its not a hard class, just taught improperly. Once the Ta went over, it was clear. ALWAYS go to tutorial and study hard for the midterm (40%) to help boost your grade. I didnt and had too much pressure for final (60%)\n",
            "Grading scale is a lot higher than most classes but she gives a lot of extra credit % points so it's not too hard to get an A. Study everything she tells you and you'll do fine. Attendence is taken so show up or call and tell her you missed class.\n",

I agree with everyone above me... he freaking... !#%^&^%@$%^&$#%^&%$ I once asked him if I can still get a B, and the answer is always... i'll talk about the final in lecture there is a histogram of the midterm score online... I know there is a freaking histogram... that everyone failed.\n",

You will get an A for show!!\n",
            "I dont even imagine there's such an instructor like this guy. Hes certainly the worst one I've ever had! Eventhough I got an easy A with more than  % overall, I have to admit that he taught me nothing except for the independent study, which means that I had to study myself and do all the homeworks in the book! Poor for all the students taking him\n",
            "He really wants to see his students push _themselves_ to succeed. He can be really intimidating sometimes but if you are confident and go to him for help, he's more than willing to help you. It's just scary talking to him in the first place if you haven't given it  % already because you feel inadequate (at least that's how it was for me).\n",
            "She was fine at first. Very caring and helpful but then the real personality came out. If you're not instantly better you will fail this class. Not for the light-hearted or those who aren't sure if music is really their thing. You have to be %  dedicated or else! Good luck...\n",

            "AMAZING!!! It is so easy to get an A. He is very clear and talkes about it in terms that anyone can understand. you get off jewish holidays!!! 2 pages of notes for every test. Tests are pretty easy if you read or come to class...you don't need to do both unless you want to. I got a  % in the class. I didn't know that was possible!!! Take Him!!!\n",

            "His lectures are sooo boring, it's scary. I had an A average throughout the whole semester, didn't miss any lectures, did ALL extra credit... AND got a B! History is my major. He f$%ked up my perfect GPA. He teaches more politics than history and is very hard on his students. D- for this guy.\n",

He worked with you to get a better grade and gave you lots of tips to write a better essay. He was honest with you and did everything he could to help, the only thing you had to do is give  %.\n",
            "The guy that said, 'This is a prof that believes that it takes 100% of the effort to get a B and  % of effort to get an A' is completely right haha. This professor isn't dull at all. He has made English interesting for me, a science major, and has so far taught me how to use writing as a tool to express myself. Will take him for 1B if I can.\n",
            "maaan, lemme tell ya a story about this here profesor.i took him in Summer. he is super laid back and shiz but that don mean he is lazy! he works his face off. I got a B but i knew i woulda got an A if i tried! DO the reading and DO attend class. This is a prof that believes that it takes 100% of the effort to get a B and  % of effort to get an A\n",

ALL HOMEWORK is for extra credit, none is collected and graded- you just SHOW it him when you hand in the tests.  Seems rough around the edges, maybe cocky, but he's great.  More than willing to help you if you need any clarifying!\n",
            "Alverson isn't teaching useable statistics. I had hopes this class would prepare me for some computational work in finance and other areas. Doesn't even use the book. I had to drop the course. He's a bit of an !@#% to some students too. There's got to be a better choice for my educational dollar.\n",
            "I disagree 100% with all the reviews saying that she is a bad teacher. She is amazing and helpful. If you engage in the material and participate in class discussion it is an easy A. I literally took no notes the entire semester. All I did was read and participate as much as possible and got  % on the midterm and  % on the final. She is awesome.\n",
            "He is very strict but he is very helpful. All you have to do is ask. If you give him  % he will give you  % back. I will admit he is not very easy and he does like to talk about his personal life but if you do your work you can pass his class. As for his stories, I think they're pretty funny.\n",
            "Very dedicated professor; willing to give  % to her students. However, even with doing absolutely everything other than study for hours a day- I still found this course difficult. I recommend her if you're willing to put the time in and you MUST visit her during office hours- it is Chemistry after all.\n",

            "Kevin is a good teacher.  If you ask for help, he is more than happy to give it.  Any poor rating is just because people are #%*@#&* lazy.  Do the reading, do the example problems, and ask for help if you need it.  If you do this, you will get an A.\n",

If you do regularly show up, do the work and have  % then she will email you if you do the daily problem check at home and tell you that work is not for you.

            "You show up to work on problems and expects you to have done video lectures by yourself. You cant even take quizzes without  having all hw at 70's and you need to get mastery points first, plus after the quiz you have quiz hw for the problems you missed. also hey the final and exam count for 80 % of your grade. i do not recommend her at all.\n",
            "Required tests and classwork are easy, but tedious.  VERY long papers but no thinking required.  It is basically copying down all of your notes for the past 2 weeks.  Tests are memorization, not critical thinking at all.  Memorize notes = A in the class.  I was going to drop it because its scary at first but was my highest grade with  %.\n",
            "I dont know what people are talking about. You can make the class easy if you pre-write you essays for the test (she GIVES you the questions a week ahead of time). extra credit is always offered, so do it. Pre-read all your papers before you turn them in and talk to her in office hours to make sure you understand what she wants. I got a  %, easy.\n",

No challenge at all if you can draw anything that resembles a donkey.\n",

            "She challenges you and won't accept bullsh#@$%ing. She puts a lot of herself and her energy into the class and her students. If you want an easy A, this isn't the class.

The class is not easy, but you can get an A if you study and pay attention. It's evident she loves what she does, and she makes it as interesting as possible. Would take again  %.\n",
            "He is a great guy. He has a great sense of humor and truly loves history. The class period is great but you have to pay attention to everything that he says for exams.

            "I've never seen a professor discourage so many students as much as her. Math is hard but demoralizing your students to take a lower level math just to fill those classes is wrong and deceitful. If WLAC has a high % of Math drop-outs it's bec. tudents aren given the chance to succeed. Encourage students to study hard instead. Thats your job!\n",
            "I enjoyed her class very much.  I thought the subject was very interesting at well.  Every once in a while on a test she would have a question about a number or %, when she said she would never tests us on a #s, so that pissed me off once or twice. Besides that, read the book and no problem getting an A/B.  She's also very nice and accommodating.\n",
            "Professor Kinicki is the holy terror. The passing grade on the midterm was under 30%, and twenty% of the class still failed it. His tests are specifically designed to make people lose points whether or not they knew the material. He asks for the output of things like (2+3  *  5) and the results of triply-nested loops. Avoid like the plague.\n",
            "He is a great guy with a lot of experience and knowledge. I learned a lot in the class. However, like most ACC classes, exams are hard and even the multiple choice questions make you think. I sometimes felt like they weren't a fair display of what I had learned. If you normally get As and Bs, it will be discouraging when exam averages are 60-ish%.\n",

Won't care about you unless you show him you're serious about class.\n",
            "She's Horrible! Do Not Take Her! She's a NUN that cares ZERO about her students. She doesn't like to explain or answer any questions when you need clarification and thinks you should already know everything about the course. Also, unfair grader on written assignment (gave 5 % out of a possible 10% for 1 mistake in 1 sentence in a 4 page paper). WOW\n",
            "Nice teacher but hard grader.  He doesn't give the grading scale at the beginning of the semester which I believe is not right. At the end of the semester don't be surprised when your % is between 80 and 83 and u have a C.\n",
            "Took her for Comm II. Her syllabus is pretty thick but she gives a lot of time to complete work. If you aren't ready to turn something in she'll give extra time. Offers A LOT of extra credit. Ended up getting like a  %.\n",

            "I love Professor Barrick! The class was interesting and fun, as long as you go, take notes and do the workbook activities this class should be an easy A. You do have to study but its nothing too difficult. He gives extra credit for completing the workbook and sometimes he takes random attendance for extra credit that help. I finished with a  %.\n",
            "Yes it's true: Mr. Barrick actually is hilarious, and makes jokes w/o effort! He's a lot of fun and a great guy BUT- The course itself only consists of 3 tests. 2 of them are 33 ?'s and the final is 34 ?'s. (Do the math, it = 100(%), which is your overall grade!) The ?'s all seem like trick questions! I barely pulled a B being a straight A student.\n",
            "I thought she was a good teacher. She expects perfection on a hundred point grade system, which is a very formidable challenge. However if she sees you put in effort, it won't go unnoticed. Not a class to be taken lightly, she expects 100% attendance and 100% effort, and even when I gave it  % I only made out with a 'B' in the course.\n",
            "Hands down one of the best professors at Calvin. Hilarious and extremely helpful. Cares so much about his students. You really have to give  %, but when you do, you'll graduate as a better designer than most art school students. He sends advice and job opportunities, and constantly pushes you harder. Take his classes!\n",
            "Easiest class I took this semester. I have one more month left with this class, my grade so far is  %. He gives out study guides for the tests, if you study them you will get an easy A. He also gives extra credit by doing concert reports!\n",
            "Easy A class if you are willing to sacrifice some nights to go to Jazz concerts. Going to the Concerts will all but ensure you won't have to take the final. Take decent notes and the tests will be no problem.  % or higher, you are excused from the final.\n",
            "Dr. August is a truly great professor that is 100 % there to help you in any way she can, as long as you are willing to put in some effort too. There are readings every week but they really aren't too bad or overwhelming. Class discussions clarify any question you could have had.. so make sure you're in class! Inspirational lady and easy A!!\n",
            "To be honest I dislike her greatly. Her lectures are very scatterd and shes is not very knowledgeable in her field at all. Provides little to no help often just telling you to look in the book etc. I caught her talking $H!% on me while talking to the lab aide when we cam in on a friday for extrahelp. VERY un professional. My expectations fall short\n",
            "Trigonometry class. He is excellent at explaining everything that you need to know for the test and is really specific and clear. All the homework is sheets that he makes up and is similar to the test. If you go to class and do the homework, you'll do well.  I have a  % going into the final and I usually get B's in math classes.\n",
            "Seriously, participate once or twice a week and you'll do fine.  If you never participate at all, then you're pretty much garanteed a bad grade.  Tests are not hard as long as you read the articles.  He offers a lot of bonus points on the tests and with participation reports.  I ended up with  %. i'm not exagerating.  Plus, Brown is pretty hot;]\n",

            "She is usually fairly nice, but gives WAY TOO much work!  It's all busy work.  She expects you to give  % of your time to her class, even if it is easy stuff.  As a person she is very nice.\n",
            "By far the easiest and most interesting of all the econ   teachers. If you go to class, study for the tests, and attend the optional discussion classes with the TA you WILL GET AN A. If you dont go to class and dont study you will fail. Tip: Sit up front he gives out +1 bonus % for the test every day. Study old tests (he reuses them)\n",
            "Decent lady in terms of helping and making things understandable cuz she knows the material. The course is boring and she comes late sometimes. The rules are based on her strict say-sos and not much else.

            "This class was not too bad. I used the book to look up terms for the midterms that's it. Discussion not mandatory but helpful. He curves, and with the size of his classes it usually at least 6-10 points. I studied the days before the exams, and even the final. Scores: 84%,  % and I got like a C on the final. Final grade: A.

VERY SPECIFIC on tests.Pure Lecture! I read the whole book too.\n",

            "Excellent teacher!  He cares whether or not you understand, and he goes over the more complex stuff in several ways so even if the first way made no sense, the second might.  Easy A- attend each lecture and pay attention. Final can displace a test if it's higher, AND final is best 50 out of 70 questions- so you could get up to a  % on final!\n",

            "Too put this simply... he will work as hard as you do. IE, If you give  % he will match that in what he gives you if you so seek it. If you give 50% you will get that from him. He is a hard ass, class is not easy, you will have to learn, stretch and think. you will get pissed off at him, if you get past that you will learn.\n",

Just didn't learn sh*%#\n",
            "I studied 8+ hrs per test and got a  % in the class. Some classmates studied 2 hrs and failed. This was my favorite class of my whole major. He challenges you but the material is great.

            "talks about his pepsi's too much. you dont need to go to class. the only thing u need is the study guide that he gives out and go to the help session that he shows up **** to bc he just got back from el hell and had a big beer. tests have at least 10 questions that make you say where the F*%$ did this come from dont ake him.\n",

If you want to learn Calculus, stay away.  If you know Calculus and you want an easy A, take her class.  My test average was a  %.  I would not take her class again.\n",
            "This class was so much work. Explanations are very technical and not enough (though some) hands on practice problems. It's very difficult for an intro course, and a lot is expected of you. Prof. Hargus is exceptionally knowledgeable, but it's hard to appreciate as she tends to assume students should dedicate  % effort to her course alone.\n",

            "I was appalled by this professor, 75 % students  were on the phone. The rest of students  either sleeping, doing homework from other class or staring  at the wall with blank face.  If your major need to have chemistry  for requirements, you would like this class. All tests are online. The syllabus outdated at BB. Don't  buy book. He uses PP a lot.\n",
            "As a business major this is the EASIEST class you will ever take. I'm in it right now and have a  % in the class. She gives alot of extra credit so take advantage of it! I loved this teacher! She is really nice, easy to understand, and most importantly, always makes sure you understand the material before moving on.\n",
            "This professor is just great.  Knows his subject and also knows how to teach it effectively. He lets you use your notes for the test, so just try going to class and take good notes and you won't even have to study too hard. If you need to take this class I would  % reccomend Mi.\n",
            "Do Not take this class if math isn't your stronger subject because you will fail ! You cannot use the calculator, or formulas during the test or final exam. No extra work given , there are no curves. Class goes at a fast pace. A lots of homework are given. 60 % of your grade comes from 2 Test. Do not take this class you will regret it .\n",
            "I took this class online and overall it was a great class. There were clear guidelines on things to be completed every week. There was a quiz (exam) every week but being online it was open book. Lots of work throughout the week with TD's, internet exercises and quizzes. Extra credit quiz at the end of semester put me at a  % overall.\n",
            "She sucks! She wasnt even there for the first 2 weeks of class and I went into the final with  % and i ended up with a B in the class. She really does base the grade on who you are not what you know.\n",

            "Prof Politi has been my favorite so far @ NCC. He is entertaining, knows his stuff, and in my opinion gives people way to much slack. Let's people hand in papers 3 weeks late. If you can't pass his class you don't belong in college. I think my Avg at the end was around  % with all the extra credit.\n",
            "I tried really hard in that class, ended up bordering between an A and a B by tenths of a %. Ended up with a B, missed it by 6 points. VERY tough grader.

            "Dr. Simms is a good history teacher. She can ramble on sometimes about things that have nothing to do with what is being discussed. She did give us the test before who took them.

            "He's not terrible as a teacher, but make sure you know the processes inside and out. He ALWAYS has one to two problems that are nothing like any problem you've ever seen before.

AVOID this @&hole.\n",

He truly wants to make a difference, and he does!\n",

Gives a lot of extra credit opportunities\n",

His classes are not for those that just want to float by, but most econ. profs don't let you just float by. He looks for the entire  % and if you don't give it your grade will suffer.  I highly recomend him though.\n",

            "The civilized world does not possess the vernacular to describe how truly BAD this man is as a teacher.  All that comes to mind is... Vindictive, sadistic, rude, trash, bulbous, cruel, tyrannic, hypocrite, and several %$#@ing other words.    Not worth the chalk he wastes scribbling incoherent symbols on the board with.\n",
            "He's nuts! He gives 3 EC % pts. at the end for attendance, reviewing your tests in his office after you take them, and watching a video or attending an event. Don't ask questions, he won't answer but he will go on for 20 minutes about something else. Just get the tests from someone who has had him.\n",
            "Shes a grandma type professor lol very sweet and kind. Gives out snacks almost every class. Grading is fair. 3 exams 50% of your grade. 2 papers 15 % (both are annoying but not too hard). Quizzes and hw are on Connect. I wouldnt take this class again because I thought it was a bit too much. However, Id only take it for her cus shes too nice :)\n",
            "Worst teacher I have ever had at LCC. Her grading is not clear and she is very picky. You will rarely ever get 100% on an assignment. If you come out with a final grade that is way off, don't be surprised.  % DO NOT recommend.\n",
            "Oh man, SHE says one things, does another!!! When will she retire, I feel sorry for every day BMCC nursing students. She can't teach for %$^& Please administration listen to this message. We need a change!!!  Seriously, I feel bad for the other students.  NURSING NEEDS COMPASSIONATE AND CARING PEOPLE, OR JUST GO BACK TO NURSING EDUCATION SCHOOL!!!\n",
            "I took his class online and it was the easiest class ive ever taken. He gives you so many chances for extra points. I had a  % in the class. The final is hard, but with all the points you have before you take it, it doesnt matter! TAKE HIM!\n",
            "VERY pedantic grader - your answers can be right but if the work is not EXACTLY the way she wants it you will lose points and your grade will suffer. HW barely counts for credit, but tests/quizzes are 50+% of your grade. She does not do a good job of teaching, but assumes you will read and do your HW and therefore teach yourself. Absolutely awful.\n",
            "I enjoyed his class, considering its pretty boring material to cover he made it fun most of the time. He was a fair teacher too (I forgot to hand in one assignment but he bumped up the % on the final). If you have to take intro to computers there isnt anything wrong taking it with him.\n",

            "Well...the sample tests she gives are so much easier then the actually test. You know that one problem in each section you just cant get, well that type will be on your test.Oh and each question on a test is worth about 10 percent.On the Final we had a question that was worth 16 %.Get that wrong and you?re screwed. Good luck. you're a god passing\n",
            "Love love love her! Nice, funny, very smart, awesome professor. Definitely tries to weed out the people who aren't serious about the class. Lots of material, but if you're taking this class, you should be interested in bio anyways. Tests are worth large %tage of grade, but lots of questions are from the multiple choice quizzes she gives. Take her!!\n",

It is important to truly understand the material presented in the opts, supplement it with the textbook readings. Tests and quizzes are hard. Our semester has at least a 5 % pt curve.  Final is cake. STUDY!:D\n",

            "He gives a good overview of the periods in American Lit and is engaging and funny. He's a pretty easy grader (he even gave me  % on a test for overall high quality of answers). As long as you keep up with the reading and take good notes, it isn't hard to do well. I loved that he got subtly annoyed with know-it-alls who made dumb comments!\n",
            "She is amazing ! Super easy and super funny ! Just because her class is easy does not mean she doesnt teach. You will learn a lot in her class. I passed with like  % . The book is not mandatory but it does help out a lot on the home test she gives. TAKE HER.\n",
            "Hard class. I had to review the notes a couple of times before understanding the material. Lecture is important but she talk a little too fast, so kind of confusing to understand. Yet, she is curving the exam, and you just need 86% to get an A. So the grading scale is set a few % below the normal.\n",
            "Awesome. Very helpful and wants his students to pass. Very accomidating with his international students. Very easy test. I got  % on the first one and didn't need to take the second.

            "I had Mr. Taylor for Math  , and he had a way of presenting the info that surprisingly got me a  % in the class. However, in Math  , he is not nearly as helpful, and even though the material isn't the hardest stuff in the world, he grades incredibly hard even for the most minor mistakes. After taking  , I would no longer recommend him.\n",

            "Tests are near impossible to finish and account for most of grade.  Does not grade on a curve.  Only covers examples exactly as written in textbook, the tests and quizzes are in a completely different format than homework.  Alot of homework assigned for very little % of grade.  Most will struggle with him unless you already know subject well.\n",
            "Professor Burton once told me to go work at McDonalds. Unlike some weak-willed students, I laughed it off and continued working hard. All professor burton wants from you is 100 % effort and he gives us valuable info about grahpic design.\n",

I ended the class with well over  % total grade. The E.C opportunities may be time consuming but teach you a lot and help your grade. Great class.\n",
            "Values lecture attendance over actual information exchange; once in lecture he wastes 10 minutes joking around at the beginning and 5 at the end taking attendance. Tests are absurdly hard for an intro class and graded as if you had a PhD in geology. Sections are like mini-seminars. Papers worth lower % of final grade than attendance. AVOID!!!!!\n",
            "Dr. Clark is a nice guy, but he's simply too old to be teaching.  It takes him a long time to go through anything in class which makes for a very boring class.  I get A's in all my other English classes but he grades so oddly that I've been getting low B's or C's.  I got 20 % off of a five page test for answering one little question wrong.  Retire.\n",
            "She writes the labs and they are very difficult to understand. When studying for the tests, it is extremely important to use the slideshows for study material. The study questions don't help THAT much. Do the extra credit projects. This class has a high drop %. Overall, I'd avoid this teacher.She IS a nice person, but as a teacher I'm not impressed\n",
            "Online- You do not need your book for this teacher. He has great power points and all test and quizes come from such. You do need to attend the online classes to get a good grade in this course. However, class attendance not required, but saved for later review. 1 quiz with 2 attempts 1 discussion weekly. Then final midterm worth 50 % of grade.\n",
            "She's very nice!! Insanely helpful! Like really really helpful. A bit bi$%#y at times, but to me its funny sarcastically. Had good laughs with friends in that class and she doesn't mind. Easy A trust me. Just don't mess too bad with the quiz, and don't miss a class.\n",
            "Biggest Jackass teacher at this school. He yells and makes stern remarks 99. % of the time. He doesn't answer questions and makes it considerably harder than it should be. Also, his handwriting is literally illegible, It's as if he learn it by writing symbols on a cave wall. Avoid at all costs.\n",
            "Easily one of the most helpful art teachers I've had sometimes she's too enthusiastic for the early a.m but that's not really even a bad thing. Can be a little hard on you but that worked well for me my skills improved  % in a single semester. Will take her class again. \n",
            "First off, note that the TAs MADE this class! They rocked! As for Deisman, well, he kinda acts like some what of a know-it all... but, all in all I'd say he was alright. He is very demanding however, and gets extremely whiny if his demands are not met  %. (WEB CT, guys: USE IT). His class was solid though, and most would agree they learnt a lot..\n",

Some of the best time and $ I've spent\n",
            "Awesome professor. Great man. He deeply cares about his students and he goes many extra miles to meet their needs. The science professors were all great, but Dr. Don Dorfman gave  % to Monmouth and the students. He always did a little extra, and the students loved him so much for that. He was an honest, caring gentlemanly guy. Loved Big Brook!!\n",
            "He is very unclear when he teaches. His tests are very hard. THE GOOD THING IS THAT HE BASED YOUR GRADE ON POINTS NOT %'s. THATS HOW I GOT a B! if it were a % I would have gotten a C. Take him if you want a nice grade!!\n",

            "Excellent professor. Her lectures are very clear. Uses power point-this all you need for the tests. Book is not really necessary-only used it twice to answer homework questions. For the tests, know the numbers/percentages she includes in her lectures-puts many questions about %. I would definitely recommend her. She is a great professor.\n",

An average of a 90 for the tests you have a 4.0, 90 is not too hard.  textbook is not necessary but very helpful.  She loves what she does and shows it.  Very clear fun and interesting.\n",
            "i absolutely adore Prof. Fourtner, he's phenomenally engaging and controversial. He doesn't force algorithms down your throat like othe Bio profs i've encountered. The class is a TON of work but  % worth every minute of every study hour. Favorite Class i've evr taken\n",
            "Easiest professor for BUAD . One quiz per week, usually always on Tuesday's and he does a quick review for it. There is a midterm and a final and the quizzes. Each worth 33% of the grade (he gives you 1 %). You will need to know how to use the excel templates but it is a a lot easier than having to do the math out by hand. Nice guy\n",
            "The best professor I have ever had, but she makes you WORK for your grade.  I gave  % and she couldn't have been more helpful.

Most assignments are easy and done on a computer program that points out your mistakes, pretty much guaranteeing a 90+% homework average, which is freaking awesome since homework is 55% of the grade. I highly recommend this class for an easy A and easy Dec B.\n",

I would take her again for another class anytime.\n",

            "This is a very easy class and professor. Attendance is not mandatory, but there are daily quizzes (answers given) that will total a test grade, so if you go every day you don't have to take a test (4th test mandatory). Text is also optional - I just bought the supplement and got a  % w/o studying. Great guy, too.\n",

Doing good in the tests is not enough to get an A.\n",

He only gets a 4 in clarity because his handwriting isn't the best but if you just ask him to clarify it, he will. Material is easy. If you dot he problem sets and study them, you're perfectly fine. His tests are formatted the same exact way. All his tests have extra credit, so the max is   %. It's all one test, there's no section for E.C.\n",

But tests that compromise 90% of our final grade that are IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH ON TIME are not representative of my skills as a student. Truly ridiculous. 10 % is devoted to a project which is a complete joke and a waste of time.\n",
            "Had to be the easiest teacher I've had at Macomb.  He lost my test 2 times, so he gave me a 100 % on both tests.  He likes to talk alot and be kinda funny.  But, he understands there is more to life than just school.\n",
            "He is an egotistical jerk.  His lectures consist of 10 % teaching new information and 90% talking about how much he knows.  Don't ask any questions because he treats everyone like their stupid if they ask a question.  He needs to retire!\n",
            "He does give a lot of notes, and your test reflexs just a small % of those notes. It does ,ake it hard to study, but he makes the subject fun.\n",

            "Excellent professor, that has hilarious stories about drugs. Midterm/Final split was 40/60 % and all multiple choice. There is a lot to memorize in this course, you need to know all the details of the slides. It is not a difficult course, just a lot of memorization including a few structures for the final.\n",
            "Very good at keeping your attention. YOU MUST HAVE THE BOOKS FOR THIS CLASS. read your notes, go to the study sessions and you will do just fine. The paper for this class is very time consuming, and you MUST read the book to stand a chance at it. Tests are Multiple chouce, T/F, MAtch) and open ended. then an takes ur highest % and adds that that.\n",
            "I was terrified after the first class with him. But now he is my favourite professor. If you give 100%, he will notice and credit you  % for that. Just don't break his rules, he'll take it personally.\n",

He sets clear criteria on what is going to be on the quiz and uploads all the power points, if you go to lectures, take notes, and study you'll do well. I'm finishing off the semester with a  %, because he does a big curve\n",
            "Multiple Choice tests were awful and questions were specific, trivial details. Watch out. Prof was nice outside of class, but inside she's not great. She raised the first two mid-term makes, 20 % and 8 %. Would not recommend this class it dropped my gpa signicantly.\n",
            "Haha my comments were deleted however like i said go to class, dont be lazy, study, read once in awhile, go to si, she curves about 10-15 percent so dont be stuck down by the lazy people, i earned a  % in the class, its college do work and study. This isnt high school. She cares about her students and will answer questions you have.\n",
            "I got a  % in the class. She gives a ridiculously high amount of extra credit and curves everything, even homework! I learned a lot in the class and the exams were really straightforward. She goes really fast in order to cover the material, so go home and review. Her notes are basically the guide for the test!\n",

            "Took her over the summer. No textbook. She assigns lots of work for a 3-credit-hour class. Be ready to give up your life by the 3rd week of the class. The navigation exercises are a b*!%@. BUT, at least she is a very easy grader.\n",
            "BUY THE NOTES FROM MAPLEPRESS; it could save your life. His tests are tough; he will give you partial credit if you work through portions and show some understanding of the material. Try to do all the homework(turn it in even if you don't complete it),the extra % bump will help. 5-6 hour final which includes  a portion of both midterms for make-up.\n",
            "I really learned a lot from her class, but she is not a fair grader when it comes to finals.  I worked very hard and got mostly high B'. At my final I got the hardest test and got a C.  My final grade was a C+.  I felt cheated out of a higher grade, especially when I was at a 79.68 %!  I was very close to a B- and that could have helped my GPA.\n",

            "Grade  attendance, midterm, and group project. The midterm was extremely hard, even after  studying and all of the reading. Some of the topics were not ever taught. However, there is a VERY generous curve that brought my exam grade from 75% to  %. But my 75% was the highest midterm grade in the class.... Boring lectures, but overall good class.\n",

            "Professor Bar was one of my favorite professors last semester. It's the first class where I've seen a 85+% attendance rate. She taught well and was very eager to help when approached. Prelims were straightforward, but due to no curves and high medians, one slip-up costed you dearly.\n",
            "I wish I needed to take more math classes, because I would take another class with him. Yes, he is hard to understand at times, but you catch on quick... Homework is manditory, and is worth more than your test % wise, its good for people like me who arnt great test takers. But his test are EASY! I made and A+ not problem, and i am not good at math.\n",
            "Key to studying is reading the textbook before and after his lectures. His exams are extremely detailed so know every step of each process and the molecular structures of the key players. When he says the time spent on x topic corresponds with x% of it on the exam - don't trust him. If he's mentioned it, it WILL be on the exam.\n",
            "Claudia is one of the nicest teachers I know. Accounting is very hard for most people yet she made it so easy on all of us by explaining things thoroughly. She doesn't grade by %, she grades by points which helped me in the long run (I had an 89% but enough points to get an A, so I got an A). She slows down when we ask and is always there to help!\n",

            "Very difficult course with a  % effort your mark will be one grade down from all your other Ryerson Economics courses. No math very theoretical. Must attend all classes. Very few hints are given for exams;you're on your own. BlackBoard stuff is little help; concentrate on class notes and textbook. Otherwise seems like a reasonably nice guy.\n",
            "never went to class found it pointless, lectures were extremely boring. everything you need to know is put up on power points but the three tests he administers have 100 questions so no matter how much you study a lot of questions seem unfamiliar. he curves a lot and provides three assignments that are worth 10 % pretty easy course overall\n",
            "I really loved kovatch as a professor. He was intelligent and really knew his stuff. Passionate about biology and ecology. He was also great about rescheduling my final exam because I was leaving the country a few days before the scheduled final. I didn't read the text book at all and skipped a few classes and still passed all the exams with 93+%.\n",

Disconnect between biologist level topics and basic learner level.Difficult exams, fine details emphasized vs. confirmation of basic knowledge.Im an A-level student, but this was total overload.\n",

Absolutley take him if you take math  \n",

As a woman I gained a better understanding of my status in society in general, thanks\n",

His tests are nice, he always give reviews b4 test which he gives most of the answers. Mostly common sense. You can pass w/o coming to class, come to class take his quiz=add %s to ur exams. Impossible NOT to get an A.\n",

            "Class is pretty easy! After the first test I didn't go to class besides the day before the test and test day. He sends out a exam review the week of the test and that helps a lot. You only have 3 test and the first 2 are worth 25% each and the final was worth 50 %.\n",

            "Makes up for his inability to teach by offering excessive amount of extra credit, which could amount to more than 10% of your grade. Except he only mentioned that % AFTER people turned them in. I scored within the top 10% for all exams and still only got an A-, because I assumed I didn't need the stupid extra credit points. Avoid at all costs.\n",

If you put in  % you will pass!!!\n",

            "Go to class, take notes, DON'T buy the book. He can be funny but is insulting and he thinks he's a genius and that he's always right. He definitely gets annoying(repeats the same s#%t over and over), but just go to class and get your A.\n",
            "Dr Hopkins makes things easy to understand and gives many examples. He also gives extra credit, so if you do not end up with an A in his class, than you are doing something wrong (I ended up with  %). He is also funny and helpful if you go to his office with questions.\n",

HW and Sample Test problems were straight or very similar on the test. Our class didn't have quizes. Overall if you work hard and study the HW and sample test youll be okay\n",
            "Great professor! I had Mr. Boryczka for   and  . If you're a slacker like 75 % of the student detail at NVC, then don't bother registering for his class. This is a University level based class. His lectures are interesting and will even give you a nick name is you stand out to him. - Clem.\n",
            "He rambles on forever.  Don't take this class with him.  He is a great person who knows a whole lot of stuff about China, but he will not help you pass your tests which are worth 50% of your grade.  His lectures and activities consist of maybe 10 % of the test.  He doesn't give a study guide so just make sure you read the whole BOOK. \n",
            "Overall the class itself is fun because you just bowl but he did not teach us anything. Sure, he put on a video but nothing was personally taught by the professor. 30 percent of the grade was scoring a bowling game but he taught no one how to score. 70 % attendance. 100 percent laziness on his part.\n",
            "Nice guy, lulls you into a false sense of security with this class though.  Go to class, even if it's not required.  This is a weeder class, and they're trying to trip you up.  My 30% on the first exam -worth 30 % of my grade- can attest to that.  STUDY HARD.\n",
            "Scherwitz is definitely crazy, but I've never had a hard time concentrating. Looking at the other PHL professors ratings, go with her. It's not that bad, and she's MORE than willing to help in office hours. went in there before every test except my first and went from a 70% to a  %. she's scatterbrained, but very very friendly. I recommend.\n",
            "Amazing teacher. If you fail his class, you either missed class everyday of the semester, you are a complete imbecile, or you are a pothead. Take him for an LAE classes and you will definetely get an A, if not ATLEAST A B. I got almost a  % in one class FYI.\n",

            "There are quizzes almost every class, which will contribute to 5 % of overall grade. He is willing to post slices after lectures, which are very helpful. Exams are straight-forward. Grading is fair. Though he is not so clear in lectures, but he is willing to help either on office hours or via emails.\n",

He is very resonable.  I loved it\n",

            "Every day I went to class hoping I'd learn something; most days I was disappointed.

            "The professor doesn't  clear everything that has to be done before an assignment or a test. She explains a few but takes lots of marks off  from many details that students didn't hear about before. She doesn't take off less than 15  % which is a lot.  Students expect to hear some clarifications afterwards, but she doesn't talk about it again.\n",

            "Dr. Lamourelle's blackboard site is extremely unorganized. Her guidelines for writing essays, and projects are the same. She did respond to all of my emails and gave out her phone number to whoever needed it, but even her responses back were confusing. One time she didn't know where to turn in an assignment. :\\. If you can keep away, KEEP AWAY!\n",

            "She is a very strict professor. No curve, no cheat sheet, little review, no multiple choice, and you can\\'t use the textbook or notes during test. She made almost no effort to find out if we understood the material before tests and hence nearly everyone failed the first test. She was unclear on what we need to study and there was  about   pages to read each month. Finally, she announced tests are related to tests, but there is so many formulas, definitions, terms, and diagrams we need to memorize that it\\'s nearly impossible to pass.\n",
            "Very nice guy, VERY confusing and vague teacher.  Many facts are outdated.  Can be very dry.  Unlike everyone else, I highly recommend using a (older version) textbook.  His slides are VERY VERY confusing and simply reading the book will be way more beneficial. Easy Gened, but don't take it if you want your money's worth (I found out too late :\\ )\n",
            "I don't know...my opinion is mixed. Her lectures are annoying - she speaks way too fast. She makes us study over 20 arbitrary images for each quiz but you only write about four. The short papers and final research paper are obnoxiously hard. However, she's much clearer if you see her in her office. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this class. :\\\n",
            "Professor Heffernan puts all other teachers to shame, he does not tolerate anything less than excellence. His passion and understanding for business and education is apparent. He will never leave you behind, if ever your understanding of business is his top priority! This class is a joy if you put in the time and effort. \\^.^/\n",

NO PHONE IN CLASS, YES LAPTOP ;-) got a B+ with good work :-\\\n",
            "Great professor! Explains everything well, tells you 90%of the topics from each chapter that will be on exams.  Probably the only teacher i could stand for a 5 and 1\\2 night class. Love her, definitely take if you can get into her intro to biology class. Also, she's extremely quick to respond to emailed questions. Read book, take notes and study!\n",
            "80% of the class grade was the exams. 20% was the homework. Luckily, the homework was graded off of effort instead of completeness however I don't think that was a very good thing. His lectures are long and pretty boring  so you have to find some way to pay attention during class. The material is near useless as well so.. :\\\n",
            "Although I rated 3 I could have gone with 5 or 1. (Much like how he marks). I enjoyed his classes and thought-provoking queries\\discussions. Obviously highly intelligent. Must truly engage this man to get the most out of it.\n",
            "Prof. Bunkse is knowledgeable RE Cultural Geography, but over the course of the semester I became convinced that Cultural Geography is his very own made up field that exists only in GEOG . Ideas are abstract, and lectures disjointed at best. If you're logic\\math\\sci oriented you'll probably struggle. If you're emotional or abstract you'll be fine\n",
            "She is a wonderful teacher. Her classes are not easy and she does not sugar coat things. So some students blame her for there short comings rather than take credit for there own actions. I would take every class with her if i could. Truly one of the smartest people i have ever met in her field. I hope to be an Aquatic Ecologist 1\\2 as good as her\n",

If you try, be on time, and do your work, you CAN'T receive anything below an A\\B.  Large amounts of homework hours given each week.  I had two A's and one B+ from him each semester.

Only 3 big assignments the whole semester plus once a week online work that you must do to pass the class.For her having surgery and being gone she did an amazing job keeping up with the class.\\\n",

            "I took her Art History: Stone Age -Gothic course online. Often did not have quizzes up on time, and would take a lot of time to respond to e-mails. However if you can easily teach yourself, the online will be fairly easy-do yourself a favor and save the notes from her online slides, because she will remove them before tests! \\\n",

Good and interesting class if you pay attention.  Study the sample questions they are on the test \\same format. Study the slides and understand them for the incorrect questions to get an a A I did\n",

            "I feel she is not easy to get an A. I got an A but my critical thinking is very good. But I think she is a pretty easy B teacher. btw, lots of homework and many discussion. A good news is she has extra credit for you.  Tosumup, lots of work, clear\\responsible teacher, not easy A.\n",
            "She doesn't really help you out on what she wants the essay to have. In her assignment requirements, it's somewhat vague and unclear. When she gives out sample papers to look at, she gives it out for us to look at the day before the rough drafts are due, which isn't really helpful. :\\ Other than that, everything else is pretty much... easy. x)\n",
            "He didn't really explain things very well, especially since i'm a audio learner. He seemed to follow the book, but the questions on the quizzes were not from the book. Maybe it might be because im a computer major, but he's also always talking about \"ice fishing in wisconsin\" and his prior business jobs. so boring :\\\n",
            "Mrs. Grabiel is a very nice lady and will tell you some of her funny stories, but this class is a lot of work. If you are looking for an easy A, this is not the class for you.

Ask lots of questions! He gives great / hilarious stories in class  as examples. You will work very hard! But you'll be rewarded in the end!\n",
            "nice person, terrible instructor. she know barely anything about photographic processes/ digital imaging and honestly has no right accepting huge sums of tuition to do so. if you take her class you will learn nothing about the stated subject matter of the class. as a now working professional with hindsight my advice would be, avoid at all costs.\n",
            "It's funny that people would say she's tough. If you attend class, skim the chaptrs before the test, know the study guides, you'll do fine.  She even has review days. She SAYS 1/2 the test q's come from the book, but as the semester wore on, most were from the lecture. Note: She's very serious about punishing cheaters and talks feminist sometimes\n",

I've gotten 100's on 5/7 tests by literally only attempting to learn the material the night before. 10 question tests with extra credit. The daily participation quizzes will get to you though, study\n",

            "Really nice!! One of the most positive professors I have had so far. If you struggle talk to him or go to tutoring in roop hall 3rd floor. He gives clicker activites, scratch off activities, and multiple choice test/short answer tests. U have to teach yourself from the book sometimes because he is older and talks monotone, but I recommend his class\n",

Very good blow off class to chill and watch people do stories they prepared. Otherwise expect a B, i thought she loved me as a student cause she always laughed at my performances.\n",
            "Class was fun and very easy. Just come to class prepared and you will do fine. The only part that was bad was the grading system. A lot of students received 8/10 on EVERYTHING, no matter if one student did much better than another. Fun, easy, but a bit confusing grading system.\n",
            "do attend her class she takes roll. she was okay always very cheerful and she really wants you to engage yourself in your performances do little voices be REALLY theatrical you'll get a better grade, i just felt like you had to more than WOW her to get a 10/10. just step out of your comfort zone and you'll get a good grade\n",

            "Class was 100 % online. The course was pretty much self paced (only deadlines, no meetings). The course used Canvas and McGraw-Hill Connect/SmartBook. Reading was understandable and exams were similar to quizzes. There was a 6 page book report and and an extra credit opportunity. This class was perfect paced for me (single mom, full time job).\n",
