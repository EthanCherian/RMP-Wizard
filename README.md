# Rate My Professors Project :)
A project to advance our Natural Language Processing skills using a practical, real-world dataset: the comments on Rate My Professor.

As of right now, there is no defined goal. However, in the near future we'd like to be able to perform Topic Modeling and/or Text Summarization.

Current stage of project: initial data analysis for over 5 million reviews scraped from the RMP website. We plan to iron out a path forward based on our findings at this stage.
