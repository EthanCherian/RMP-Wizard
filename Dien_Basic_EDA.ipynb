            "He's great! Doesn't waste time on information that you won't need or use. His explanations are geared so you don't memorize but understand the material logically. One of the best and easiest math classes you'll ever take. Great personality! 3 5\n",

He dose not like anything with the athletic dept. so if any of yall are athlete out there. GOODLUCK! this class is only for pre-pt and exercise science. do not messed up your lab grades. 1 3\n",

As long you actually do the reading and take notes you should get an B or an A. Make sure you choose a good group for group work. Overall pretty good! 5 3\n",

However, her exams are of a shock and awe style whereby there will be a good portion of questions that are much more complex than her examples or homework. Expect long exams with limited time and if you are a self-learner expect to see her choice of textbook to have very limited answers. 5 3\n",

Moreover, his tests are lame for no one knows what to expect from him. It's usually 15 multiple choices and 2 T-charts; multiple choices are hard!! He always reply with no manner 1 3\n",

            "Her lectures are straight from the book. She grades hard on speeches, which make up most of your grade. Grading system is different. However she does make herself available for help including giving out her cell phone number. No test reviews. Tests are hard and fill in the blank or paragraph. You must really understand the material. 5 3\n",

The test is straight from the study guide, so study it intensively. She will try to help you if you ask as well as modify the class with student suggestions. She gave us lots of extra credit. 3 1\n",

Labs NEVER last 2 hour, we always get out early and he tells you exactly what to study for his quizzes. Final was in pair and only on the last chapter. I ended up with an A. TAKE HIMMM! 5 3\n",

A lot of group work, takes attendance that way. Midterm is a powerpoint presenation about something French related. Easy Grader, nice lady! Just do the work and get an A no problem. 2 4\n",

Averages for tests were below 55, and he wouldn't give a concrete answer on what to expect with a grade curve.

            "It's not the easiest class, but I loved it! Tests are mostly multiple choice with some blue book essays, take A LOT of notes and study and you'll be fine. She is fair, but you definitely want to be on her good side- easy to do, just pay attention, be engaged and work hard. She knows her subject VERY well. She has a no-nonsense attitude which can come off as curt, but shes actually really nice if you are. Think about a question before asking, she doesn't like to be interrupted for trivial things.\n",

I know everyone is not perfect but you think with her experience she would be a little better. I didn't pass this class for two reasons one being that I didn't study like i should have and two things were not always clear. Majority of the people in the class thought the same thing. There were some really good students in the class and they didn't even pass with with flying colors. \n",

You can go without reading the material if you attend every class and still get an A because he does allow extra credit and adds only a little more content which is not in the book which has all the notes you would need. I am already Finra licensed series 6 and 63 and I learned a lot which would be Ina series 7 and 66 exam.\n",

Class is very simple as long as prepare for class by taking notes, listening to music, studying information, and  getting involved.  Some students didn't care for dry sense of humor on wrong answers and may seem conceited, but overall cares about the class and wants students to learn information and do well.  Sometimes the dry humor was what was needed to get a laugh during lecture, but highly recommend overall.  Would take another class with him if able to and for the ladies a hottie...Great job..\n",

This is an intro course. I wrote just about as much in this class as I did in my English class. Pathetic. Not to mention if you are late at all with anything during the semester you will be retaking the class because he doesn't care about anything that might come up. If you write the 12 page paper and turn it in 10 min late, you get a 0.\n",

But, if you aim at a easy-A class, I'm not sure if this is the right one for you. There will be homework, some papers, quizzes, and prelab on no-exam days; if there is an exam coming, you have to study hard. A is not impossible, because I'm the A student in her class. I got one 100%, one 99% and one 94% on exams so far. A is possible but I did study hard; don't look at my grade and assume everything will be easy since only 2 people got an A and half of my classmates got Cs or failed when I got 99%. I'm telling this because I don't want you to get tricked by my grades. She does curve, depending on the highest score. The most important thing is to read the book, study the notes, memorize everything you need to memorize. Her study guide helps a lot. But again, I did study hard; I am always the 100% student in bio class but this one, I have to study hard to get an A. If you are such a person like me, you should have no difficulty to nail this class; but if you are not, you may straggle in this class. I will say mesmerizing is important but passion is more important. I am good at bio because I love biology from my heart, not because I can memorize the whole book; no one can memorize the whole book. Strictly memorizing will not work unless you have no difficulty in memorizing 1.5k pages; try to understand the content itself rather than strictly memorizing. If you don't understand the content, you will mess them up since there is too much. Memorizing and understanding are the most important things -- of course, this is biology.\n",

He is very considerate and he works with you as much as you need it. He takes the time to go over every essay with you and corrects and helps you on everything you need help on. I took a summer class while pregnant and I aced his class! Recommended!\n",

            "She was amazing !! I loved her class, it wasn't an easy one but it was worth taking, the first year since she was caring towards her students and educating them in a right manner. I remember the first ever exam I wrote in my university life it was her's and I was freaking out.   She so adorable and generous, the women came in the exam room and checked up on her students. Not only that but she came to me and gave me a pat on the back and \"told me everything will be okay, just give it you're all\". Lovely women ! just work hard in her class or you won't pass !\n",

            "This professor definitely is straight forward and strict. The few weeks I was in his classroom he continously embarrassed different students by asking if they were dyslexic, had test anxiety, or was taking other classes that interferred with his. He suggested every student that worked, had kids and a family or taking multiple classes to put his class first. He gives you a short lecture and expects you to teach yourself through the semeseter. i do not want to take another on eof his courses. If you have not taken him before stay away. If you prefer a hard teacher who cuts you no slack be my guest. Good luck!\n",

            "This was one of my first classes at Towson University. It was very inspirational. I would not say the class is very difficult, but it is not the easiest. Carrie is very knowledgeable in her field, contemporary art, and art as a whole. She can be hard when it comes to one-on-one critiques but in a GOOD way! What are critiques for... \"critiquing\" (how do you expect to improve?). There are four main projects due in her class where you learn about different artists. All the lectures are intriguing and I would definitely take another class with her. All you have to do is follow simple instructions and show up to class.\n",

            "To any future students going on to the medical field and you would actually like to learn something of value, take Dr. Pomeranz's class. Her teaching method is unique. How so? Well, indoctrinating beliefs don't fall into her teaching process, shes honest and quite funny too. She is a great source of knowledge but she not only tells you what she knows about the medical field and its endeavorsprerequisites; she explains how you can apply such knowledge in order to benefit you and others. Examples: which vitamins aid for certain illnesses, how to protect yourself legally and in the aspect of health, and whats going to be expected of you upon graduation. I can go on but like a movie I wouldnt like to spoil anything. Take her class, I certainly dont regret it. \n",
